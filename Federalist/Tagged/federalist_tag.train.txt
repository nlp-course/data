<bos>	O
the	O
last	O
paper	O
having	O
concluded	O
the	O
observations	O
which	O
were	O
meant	O
to	O
introduce	O
a	O
candid	O
survey	O
of	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
government	O
reported	O
by	O
the	O
convention	,
we	O
now	O
proceed	O
to	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
undertaking	.

<bos>	O
the	O
first	O
question	O
that	O
offers	O
itself	O
is	,
whether	O
the	O
general	O
form	O
and	O
aspect	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
be	O
strictly	O
republican	.
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
no	O
other	O
form	O
would	O
be	O
reconcilable	O
with	O
the	O
genius	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
america	;
with	O
the	O
fundamental	O
principles	O
of	O
the	O
revolution	;
or	O
with	O
that	O
honorable	O
determination	O
which	O
animates	O
every	O
votary	O
of	O
freedom	,
to	O
rest	O
all	O
our	O
political	O
experiments	O
on	O
the	O
capacity	O
of	O
mankind	O
for	O
self-government	.
if	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	,
therefore	,
be	O
found	O
to	O
depart	O
from	O
the	O
republican	O
character	,
its	O
advocates	O
must	O
abandon	O
it	O
as	O
no	O
longer	O
defensible	.

<bos>	O
what	,
then	,
are	O
the	O
distinctive	O
characters	O
of	O
the	O
republican	O
form	?
were	O
an	O
answer	O
to	O
this	O
question	O
to	O
be	O
sought	,
not	O
by	O
recurring	O
to	O
principles	,
but	O
in	O
the	O
application	O
of	O
the	O
term	O
by	O
political	O
writers	,
to	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O

on	O

the	O
honorable	O

for	O

the	O
next	O
relation	O
is	,
to	O
the	O
sources	O
from	O
which	O
the	O
ordinary	O
powers	O
of	O
government	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
derived	.
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	O
will	O
derive	O
its	O
powers	O
from	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
america	;
and	O
the	O
people	O
will	O
be	O
represented	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
proportion	,
and	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
principle	,
as	O
they	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
legislature	O
of	O
a	O
particular	O
state	.
so	O
far	O
the	O
government	O
is	O
national	,
not	O
federal	.
the	O
senate	,
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	,
will	O
derive	O
its	O
powers	O
from	O
the	O
states	,
as	O
political	O
and	O
coequal	O
societies	;
and	O
these	O
will	O
be	O

the	O
principle	O
of	O
equality	O
in	O
the	O
senate	,
as	O
they	O
now	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
existing	O
congress	.
so	O
far	O
the	O
government	O
is	O
federal	,
not	O
national	.
the	O
executive	O
power	O
will	O
be	O
derived	O
from	O
a	O
very	O
compound	O
source	.
the	O
immediate	O
election	O
of	O
the	O
president	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
by	O
the	O
states	O
in	O
their	O
political	O
characters	.
the	O
votes	O
allotted	O
to	O
them	O
are	O
in	O
a	O
compound	O
ratio	,
which	O
considers	O
them	O
partly	O
as	O
distinct	O
and	O
coequal	O
societies	,
partly	O
as	O
unequal	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
society	.
the	O
eventual	O
election	,
again	,
is	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
by	O
that	O
branch	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	O
which	O
consists	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
representatives	;
but	O
in	O
this	O
particular	O
act	O
they	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
thrown	O
into	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
individual	O
delegations	,
from	O
so	O
many	O
distinct	O
and	O
coequal	O
bodies	O
politic	.
from	O
this	O
aspect	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
it	O
appears	O
to	O
be	O
of	O
a	O
mixed	O
character	,
presenting	O
at	O
least	O
as	O
many	O
federal	O
as	O
national	O
features	.

<bos>	O
the	O
difference	O
between	O
a	O
federal	O
and	O
national	O
government	,
as	O
it	O
relates	O
to	O
the	O
operation	O
of	O
the	O
government	,
is	O
supposed	O
to	O
consist	O
in	O
this	,
that	O
in	O
the	O
former	O
the	O
powers	O
operate	O
on	O
the	O
political	O
bodies	O
composing	O
the	O
confederacy	,
in	O
their	O
political	O
capacities	;
in	O
the	O
latter	,
on	O
the	O
individual	O
citizens	O
composing	O
the	O
nation	,
in	O
their	O
individual	O
capacities	.
on	O
trying	O
the	O
constitution	O
by	O
this	O
criterion	,
it	O
falls	O
under	O
the	O
national	,
not	O
the	O
federal	O
character	;
though	O
perhaps	O
not	O
so	O
completely	O
as	O
has	O
been	O
understood	.
in	O
several	O
cases	,
and	O
particularly	O
in	O
the	O
trial	O
of	O
controversies	O
to	O
which	O
states	O
may	O
be	O
parties	,
they	O
must	O
be	O
viewed	O
and	O
proceeded	O
against	O
in	O
their	O
collective	O
and	O
political	O
capacities	O
only	.
so	O
far	O
the	O
national	O
countenance	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
on	O
this	O
side	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
disfigured	O
by	O
a	O
few	O
federal	O
features	.
but	O
this	O
blemish	O
is	O
perhaps	O
unavoidable	O
in	O
any	O
plan	;
and	O
the	O
operation	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
on	O
the	O
people	,
in	O
their	O
individual	O
capacities	,
in	O
its	O
ordinary	O
and	O
most	O
essential	O
proceedings	,
may	,
on	O
the	O
whole	,
designate	O
it	,
in	O
this	O
relation	,
a	O
national	O
government	.

<bos>	O
but	O
if	O
the	O
government	O
be	O
national	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
operation	O
of	O
its	O
powers	,
it	O
changes	O
its	O
aspect	O
again	O
when	O
we	O
contemplate	O
it	O
in	O
relation	O
to	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
its	O
powers	.
the	O
idea	O
of	O
a	O
national	O
government	O
involves	O
in	O
it	,
not	O
only	O
an	O
authority	O
over	O
the	O
individual	O
citizens	,
but	O
an	O
indefinite	O
supremacy	O
over	O
all	O
persons	O
and	O
things	,
so	O
far	O
as	O
they	O
are	O
objects	O
of	O
lawful	O
government	.
among	O
a	O
people	O
consolidated	O
into	O
one	O
nation	,
this	O
supremacy	O
is	O
completely	O
vested	O
in	O
the	O
national	O
legislature	.
among	O
communities	O
united	O
for	O
particular	O
purposes	,
it	O
is	O
vested	O
partly	O
in	O
the	O
general	O
and	O
partly	O
in	O
the	O
municipal	O
legislatures	.
in	O
the	O
former	O
case	,
all	O
local	O
authorities	O
are	O
subordinate	O
to	O
the	O
supreme	;
and	O
may	O
be	O
controlled	,
directed	,
or	O
abolished	O
by	O
it	O
at	O
pleasure	.
in	O
the	O
latter	,
the	O
local	O
or	O
municipal	O
authorities	O
form	O
distinct	O
and	O
independent	O
portions	O
of	O
the	O
supremacy	,
no	O
more	O
subject	,
within	O
their	O
respective	O
spheres	,
to	O
the	O
general	O
authority	,
than	O
the	O
general	O
authority	O
is	O
subject	O
to	O
them	,
within	O
its	O
own	O
sphere	.
in	O
this	O
relation	,
then	,
the	O
proposed	O
government	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
deemed	O
a	O
national	O
one	;
since	O
its	O
jurisdiction	O
extends	O
to	O
certain	O
enumerated	O
objects	O
only	,
and	O
leaves	O
to	O
the	O
several	O
states	O
a	O
residuary	O
and	O
inviolable	O
sovereignty	O
over	O
all	O
other	O
objects	.
it	O
is	O
true	O
that	O
in	O
controversies	O
relating	O
to	O
the	O
boundary	O
between	O
the	O
two	O
jurisdictions	,
the	O
tribunal	O
which	O
is	O
ultimately	O
to	O
decide	,
is	O
to	O
be	O
established	O
under	O
the	O
general	O
government	.
but	O
this	O
does	O
not	O
change	O
the	O
principle	O
of	O
the	O
case	.
the	O
decision	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
impartially	O
made	,
according	O
to	O
the	O
rules	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	;
and	O
all	O
the	O
usual	O
and	O
most	O
effectual	O
precautions	O
are	O
taken	O
to	O
secure	O
this	O
impartiality	.
some	O
such	O
tribunal	O
is	O
clearly	O
essential	O
to	O
prevent	O
an	O
appeal	O
to	O
the	O
sword	O
and	O
a	O
dissolution	O
of	O
the	O
compact	;
and	O
that	O
it	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
established	O
under	O
the	O
general	O
rather	O
than	O
under	O
the	O
local	O
governments	,
or	,
to	O
speak	O
more	O
properly	,
that	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
safely	O
established	O
under	O
the	O
first	O
alone	,
is	O
a	O
position	O
not	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
combated	.

<bos>	O
if	O
we	O
try	O
the	O
constitution	O
by	O
its	O
last	O
relation	O
to	O
the	O
authority	O
by	O
which	O
amendments	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
made	,
we	O
find	O
it	O
neither	O
wholly	O
national	O
nor	O
wholly	O
federal	.
were	O
it	O
wholly	O
national	,
the	O
supreme	O
and	O
ultimate	O
authority	O
would	O
reside	O
in	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
union	;
and	O
this	O
authority	O
would	O
be	O
competent	O
at	O
all	O
times	,
like	O
that	O
of	O
a	O
majority	O
of	O
every	O
national	O
society	,
to	O
alter	O
or	O
abolish	O
its	O
established	O
government	.
were	O
it	O
wholly	O
federal	,
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	,
the	O
concurrence	O
of	O
each	O
state	O
in	O
the	O
union	O
would	O
be	O
essential	O
to	O
every	O
alteration	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
binding	O
on	O
all	.
the	O
mode	O
provided	O
by	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	O
is	O
not	O
founded	O
on	O
either	O
of	O
these	O
principles	.
in	O
requiring	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
majority	,
and	O
principles	.
in	O
requiring	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
majority	,
and	O
particularly	O
in	O
computing	O
the	O
proportion	O
by	O
states	,
not	O
by	O
citizens	,
it	O
departs	O
from	O
the	O
national	O
and	O
advances	O
towards	O
the	O
federal	O
character	;
in	O
rendering	O
the	O
concurrence	O
of	O
less	O
than	O
the	O
whole	O
number	O
of	O
states	O
sufficient	,
it	O
loses	O
again	O
the	O
federal	O
and	O
partakes	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
character	.

<bos>	O
the	O
proposed	O
constitution	,
therefore	,
is	,
in	O
strictness	,
neither	O
a	O
national	O
nor	O
a	O
federal	O
constitution	,
but	O
a	O
composition	O
of	O
both	.
in	O
its	O
foundation	O
it	O
is	O
federal	,
not	O
national	;
in	O
the	O
sources	O
from	O
which	O
the	O
ordinary	O
powers	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
are	O
drawn	,
it	O
is	O
partly	O
federal	O
and	O
partly	O
national	;
in	O
the	O
operation	O
of	O
these	O
powers	,
it	O
is	O
national	,
not	O
federal	;
in	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
them	,
again	,
it	O
is	O
federal	,
not	O
national	;
and	,
finally	,
in	O
the	O
authoritative	O
mode	O
of	O
introducing	O
amendments	,
it	O
is	O
neither	O
wholly	O
federal	O
nor	O
wholly	O
national	.

<bos>	O
the	O
second	O
point	O
to	O
be	O
examined	O
is	,
whether	O
the	O
convention	O
were	O
authorized	O
to	O
frame	O
and	O
propose	O
this	O
mixed	O
constitution	.
the	O
powers	O
of	O
the	O
convention	O
ought	,
in	O
strictness	,
to	O
be	O
determined	O
by	O
an	O
inspection	O
of	O
the	O
commissions	O
given	O
to	O
the	O

september	,
1786	,

to	O
that	O
from	O
congress	,
in	O
february	,

it	O
will	O
be	O
sufficient	O
to	O
recur	O
to	O
these	O
particular	O
acts	.

``	O
from	O
these	O
two	O
acts	,
it	O
appears	,
1st	,
that	O
the	O
object	O
of	O
the	O
convention	O
was	O
to	O
establish	,
in	O
these	O

a	O

i	O
ask	,
what	O
are	O
these	O

do	O
they	O

that	,
in	O

of	O

<bos>	O
do	O
these	O
fundamental	O
principles	O
require	,
particularly	,
that	O
no	O
tax	O
should	O
be	O
levied	O
without	O
the	O
intermediate	O
agency	O
of	O
the	O
states	?
the	O
confederation	O
itself	O
authorizes	O
a	O
direct	O
tax	,
to	O
a	O
certain	O
extent	,
on	O
the	O
post	O

the	O
power	O

construed	O
by	O
congress	O
as	O
to	O
levy	O
a	O
tribute	O
immediately	O
from	O
that	O
source	O
also	.
but	O
pretermitting	O
these	O
instances	,
was	O
it	O
not	O
an	O
acknowledged	O
object	O
of	O
the	O
convention	O
and	O
the	O
universal	O
expectation	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
that	O
the	O
regulation	O
of	O

should	O
be	O
submitted	O
to	O
the	O
general	O

in	O
such	O
a	O
form	O
as	O
would	O
render	O
it	O
an	O
immediate	O
source	O
of	O

revenue	?
had	O
not	O
congress	O
repeatedly	O
recommended	O
this	O
measure	O
as	O
not	O
inconsistent	O
with	O
the	O
fundamental	O
principles	O
of	O
the	O
confederation	?
had	O
not	O
every	O

but	O
one	;

not	O
new	O

herself	,
so	O
far	O
complied	O
with	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
congress	O
as	O
to	O
recognize	O
the	O
principle	O
of	O
the	O
innovation	?
do	O
these	O
principles	,
in	O
fine	,
require	O
that	O
the	O
powers	O
of	O
the	O
general	O
government	O
should	O
be	O
limited	,
and	O
that	,
beyond	O
this	O
limit	,
the	O
states	O
should	O
be	O
left	O
in	O
possession	O
of	O
their	O
sovereignty	O
and	O
independence	?
we	O
have	O
seen	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
new	O
government	,
as	O
in	O
the	O
old	,
the	O
general	O
powers	O
are	O
limited	;
and	O
that	O
the	O
states	,
in	O
all	O
unenumerated	O
cases	,
are	O
left	O
in	O
the	O
enjoyment	O
of	O
their	O
sovereign	O
and	O

jurisdiction	.

<bos>	O
the	O
truth	O
is	,
that	O
the	O
great	O
principles	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	O
proposed	O
by	O
the	O
convention	O
may	O
be	O
considered	O
less	O
as	O
absolutely	O
new	,
than	O
as	O
the	O
expansion	O
of	O
principles	O
which	O
are	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
articles	O
of	O
confederation	.
the	O
misfortune	O
under	O
the	O
latter	O
system	O
has	O
been	,
that	O
these	O
principles	O
are	O
so	O
feeble	O
and	O
confined	O
as	O
to	O
justify	O
all	O
the	O
charges	O
of	O
inefficiency	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
urged	O
against	O
it	,
and	O
to	O
require	O
a	O
degree	O
of	O
enlargement	O
which	O
gives	O
to	O
the	O
new	O
system	O
the	O
aspect	O
of	O
an	O
entire	O
transformation	O
of	O
the	O
old	.
in	O
one	O
particular	O
it	O
is	O
admitted	O
that	O
the	O
convention	O
have	O
departed	O
from	O
the	O
tenor	O
of	O
their	O
commission	.
instead	O
of	O
reporting	O
a	O
plan	O
requiring	O
the	O
confirmation	O
of	O
the	O
legislatures	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
states	,
they	O
have	O
reported	O
a	O
plan	O
which	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
confirmed	O
by	O
the	O
people	,
and	O
may	O
be	O
carried	O
into	O
effect	O
by	O
nine	O
states	O
only	.
it	O
is	O
worthy	O
of	O
remark	O
that	O
this	O
objection	,
though	O
the	O
most	O
plausible	,
has	O
been	O
the	O
least	O
urged	O
in	O
the	O
publications	O
which	O
have	O
swarmed	O
against	O
the	O
convention	.
the	O
forbearance	O
can	O
only	O
have	O
proceeded	O
from	O
an	O
irresistible	O
conviction	O
of	O
the	O
absurdity	O
of	O
subjecting	O
the	O
fate	O
of	O
twelve	O
states	O
to	O
the	O
perverseness	O
or	O
corruption	O
of	O
a	O
thirteenth	;
from	O
the	O
example	O
of	O
inflexible	O
opposition	O
given	O
by	O
a	O
majority	O
of	O
one	O
sixtieth	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
america	O
to	O
a	O
measure	O
approved	O
and	O
called	O
for	O
by	O
the	O
voice	O
of	O
twelve	O
states	,
comprising	O
fifty-nine	O
sixtieths	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
an	O
example	O
still	O
fresh	O
in	O
the	O
memory	O
and	O
indignation	O
of	O
every	O
citizen	O
who	O
has	O
felt	O
for	O
the	O
wounded	O
honor	O
and	O
prosperity	O
of	O
his	O
country	.
as	O
this	O
objection	,
therefore	,
has	O
been	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
waived	O
by	O
those	O
who	O
have	O
criticised	O
the	O
powers	O
of	O
the	O
convention	,
i	O
dismiss	O
it	O
without	O
further	O
observation	.

<bos>	O
the	O
third	O
point	O
to	O
be	O
inquired	O
into	O
is	,
how	O
far	O
considerations	O
of	O
duty	O
arising	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
case	O
itself	O
could	O
have	O
supplied	O
any	O
defect	O
of	O
regular	O
authority	.
in	O
the	O
preceding	O
inquiries	O
the	O
powers	O
of	O
the	O
convention	O
have	O
been	O
analyzed	O
and	O
tried	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
rigor	,
and	O
by	O
the	O
same	O
rules	,
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
real	O
and	O
final	O
powers	O
for	O
the	O
establishment	O
of	O
a	O
constitution	O
for	O
the	O
united	O
states	.
we	O
have	O
seen	O
in	O
what	O
manner	O
they	O
have	O
borne	O
the	O
trial	O
even	O
on	O
that	O
supposition	.
it	O
is	O
time	O
now	O
to	O
recollect	O
that	O
the	O
powers	O
were	O
merely	O
advisory	O
and	O
recommendatory	;
that	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
meant	O
by	O
the	O
states	,
and	O
so	O
understood	O
by	O
the	O
convention	;
and	O
that	O
the	O
latter	O
have	O
accordingly	O
planned	O
and	O
proposed	O
a	O
constitution	O
which	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
of	O
no	O
more	O
consequence	O
than	O
the	O
paper	O
on	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
written	,
unless	O
it	O
be	O
stamped	O
with	O
the	O
approbation	O
of	O
those	O
to	O
whom	O
it	O
is	O
addressed	.
this	O
reflection	O
places	O
the	O
subject	O
in	O
a	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
altogether	O
different	,
and	O
will	O
enable	O
us	O
to	O
judge	O
with	O
propriety	O
of	O
the	O
course	O
taken	O
by	O
the	O
convention	.
let	O
us	O
view	O
the	O
ground	O
on	O
which	O
the	O
convention	O
stood	.

<bos>	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
collected	O
from	O
their	O
proceedings	,
that	O
they	O
were	O
deeply	O
and	O
unanimously	O
impressed	O
with	O
the	O
crisis	,
which	O
had	O
led	O
their	O
country	O
almost	O
with	O
one	O
voice	O
to	O
make	O
so	O
singular	O
and	O
solemn	O
an	O
experiment	O
for	O
correcting	O
the	O
errors	O
of	O
a	O
system	O
by	O
which	O
this	O
crisis	O
had	O
been	O
produced	;
that	O
they	O
were	O
no	O
less	O
deeply	O
and	O
unanimously	O
convinced	O
that	O
such	O
a	O
reform	O
as	O
they	O
have	O
proposed	O
was	O
absolutely	O
necessary	O
to	O
effect	O
the	O
purposes	O
of	O
their	O
appointment	.
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
unknown	O
to	O
them	O
that	O
the	O
hopes	O
and	O
expectations	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
body	O
of	O
citizens	,
throughout	O
this	O
great	O
empire	,
were	O
turned	O
with	O
the	O
keenest	O
anxiety	O
to	O
the	O
event	O
of	O
their	O
deliberations	.
they	O
had	O
every	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
contrary	O
sentiments	O
agitated	O
the	O
minds	O
and	O

of	O
every	O
external	O

foe	O
to	O
the	O
liberty	O
and	O
prosperity	O
of	O
the	O

<bos>	O
they	O
had	O
seen	O
in	O
the	O
origin	O
and	O
progress	O
of	O
the	O
experiment	,
the	O
alacrity	O
with	O
which	O

by	O
a	O
single	O
state	(

towards	O
a	O
partial	O
amendment	O
of	O
the	O
confederation	,
had	O
been	O
attended	O
to	O
and	O
promoted	.
they	O
had	O
seen	O
the	O
liberty	O
assumed	O
by	O
a	O
very	O
few	O
deputies	O
from	O
a	O
very	O
few	O
states	,

at	O
annapolis	,
of	O
recommending	O
a	O
great	O
and	O
critical	O
object	,
wholly	O

to	O
their	O
commission	,
not	O

the	O
sum	O

let	O
them	O
speak	O
for	O
themselves	.
this	O
one	O
tells	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
proposed	O
constitution	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
rejected	,
because	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
confederation	O
of	O
the	O
states	,
but	O
a	O
government	O
over	O
individuals	.
another	O
admits	O
that	O
it	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
government	O
over	O
individuals	O
to	O
a	O
certain	O
extent	,
but	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
to	O
the	O
extent	O
proposed	.
a	O
third	O
does	O
not	O
object	O
to	O
the	O
government	O
over	O
individuals	,
or	O
to	O
the	O
extent	O
proposed	,
but	O
to	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
a	O
bill	O
of	O
rights	.
a	O
fourth	O
concurs	O
in	O
the	O
absolute	O
necessity	O
of	O
a	O
bill	O
of	O
rights	,
but	O
contends	O
that	O
it	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
declaratory	,
not	O
of	O
the	O
personal	O
rights	O
of	O
individuals	,
but	O
of	O
the	O
rights	O
reserved	O
to	O
the	O
states	O
in	O
their	O
political	O
capacity	.
a	O
fifth	O
is	O
of	O
opinion	O
that	O
a	O
bill	O
of	O
rights	O
of	O
any	O
sort	O
would	O
be	O
superfluous	O
and	O
misplaced	,
and	O
that	O
the	O
plan	O
would	O
be	O
unexceptionable	O

for	O
the	O
fatal	O
power	O
of	O
regulating	O

an	O
objector	O
in	O

against	O

equality	O

representation	O
in	O
the	O
senate	.
an	O
objector	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
state	O
is	O
equally	O
loud	O
against	O
the	O
dangerous	O
inequality	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	.
from	O
this	O
quarter	,
we	O
are	O
alarmed	O
with	O
the	O

expense	,
from	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
persons	O
who	O
are	O
to	O
administer	O
the	O

government	.
from	O
another	O
quarter	,
and	O
sometimes	O
from	O
the	O
same	O
quarter	,
on	O
another	O
occasion	,
the	O
cry	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
congress	O
will	O
be	O
but	O
a	O
shadow	O
of	O
a	O
representation	,
and	O
that	O
the	O
government	O
would	O
be	O
far	O
less	O
objectionable	O
if	O
the	O
number	O
and	O
the	O
expense	O
were	O
doubled	.
a	O
patriot	O
in	O

state	O

objections	O
against	O
the	O
power	O
of	O

taxation	.
the	O
patriotic	O
adversary	O
in	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
great	O
exports	O
and	O
imports	,
is	O
not	O
less	O
dissatisfied	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
burden	O
of	O
taxes	O
may	O
be	O
thrown	O
on	O
consumption	.
this	O
politician	O
discovers	O
in	O
the	O
constitution	O
a	O
direct	O
and	O
irresistible	O
tendency	O
to	O
monarchy	;
that	O
is	O
equally	O
sure	O
it	O
will	O
end	O
in	O
aristocracy	.
another	O
is	O
puzzled	O
to	O
say	O
which	O
of	O
these	O
shapes	O
it	O
will	O
ultimately	O
assume	,
but	O
sees	O
clearly	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
one	O
or	O
other	O
of	O
them	;
whilst	O
a	O
fourth	O
is	O
not	O
wanting	,
who	O
with	O
no	O
less	O
confidence	O
affirms	O
that	O
the	O
constitution	O
is	O
so	O
far	O
from	O
having	O
a	O
bias	O
towards	O
either	O
of	O
these	O
dangers	,
that	O
the	O
weight	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
sufficient	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O
upright	O
and	O
firm	O
against	O
its	O
opposite	O
propensities	.
with	O
another	O
class	O
of	O
adversaries	O
to	O
the	O
constitution	O
the	O
language	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
legislative	,
executive	,
and	O
judiciary	O
departments	O
are	O
intermixed	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
as	O
to	O
contradict	O
all	O
the	O
ideas	O
of	O
regular	O
government	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
requisite	O
precautions	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
liberty	.
whilst	O
this	O
objection	O
circulates	O
in	O
vague	O
and	O
general	O
expressions	,
there	O
are	O
but	O
a	O
few	O
who	O
lend	O
their	O
sanction	O
to	O
it	.
let	O
each	O
one	O
come	O
forward	O
with	O
his	O
particular	O
explanation	,

two	O
are	O
exactly	O

upon	O
the	O
subject	.

instead	O
of	O

this	O

the	O

part	O
of	O

organization	.

another	,

that	O

of	O

with	O

an	O
indefinite	O
power	O
to	O

dangerous	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

the	O

to	O

that	O
power	O
also	;
and	O
they	O
have	O
already	O

to	O

are	O
the	O
sole	O
depositary	O
of	O
all	O
the	O

is	O
it	O
particularly	O
dangerous	O
to	O
give	O
the	O
keys	O
of	O
the	O
treasury	,
and	O
the	O
command	O
of	O
the	O

to	O
liberty	?
the	O
confederation	O
has	O
no	O
bill	O
of	O

is	O
it	O
an	O
objection	O
against	O
the	O
new	O
constitution	,
that	O
it	O
empowers	O
the	O
senate	,
with	O
the	O
concurrence	O
of	O
the	O
executive	,
to	O
make	O
treaties	O
which	O
are	O

the	O
existing	O
congress	,
without	O
any	O
such	O
control	,
can	O
make	O
treaties	O
which	O
they	O
themselves	O
have	O
declared	,
and	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
states	O
have	O
recognized	,
to	O
be	O
the	O
supreme	O
law	O
of	O

is	O
the	O

for	O
twenty	O

by	O
the	O

it	O

forever	.

<bos>	O
i	O
shall	O
be	O
told	,
that	O
however	O
dangerous	O
this	O
mixture	O
of	O
powers	O
may	O
be	O
in	O
theory	,
it	O
is	O
rendered	O
harmless	O
by	O
the	O
dependence	O
of	O
congress	O
on	O
the	O
state	O
for	O
the	O
means	O
of	O
carrying	O
them	O
into	O
practice	;
that	O
however	O
large	O
the	O
mass	O
of	O
powers	O
may	O
be	,
it	O
is	O
in	O
fact	O
a	O
lifeless	O
mass	.
then	,
say	O
i	,
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	,
that	O
the	O
confederation	O
is	O
chargeable	O
with	O
the	O
still	O
greater	O
folly	O
of	O
declaring	O
certain	O
powers	O
in	O
the	O
federal	O
government	O
to	O
be	O
absolutely	O
necessary	,
and	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
rendering	O
them	O
absolutely	O
nugatory	;
and	,
in	O
the	O
next	O
place	,
that	O
if	O
the	O
union	O
is	O
to	O
continue	,
and	O
no	O
better	O
government	O
be	O
substituted	,
effective	O
powers	O
must	O
either	O
be	O
granted	O
to	,
or	O
assumed	O
by	,
the	O
existing	O
congress	;
in	O
either	O
of	O
which	O
events	,
the	O
contrast	O
just	O
stated	O
will	O
hold	O
good	.
but	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
all	.
out	O
of	O
this	O
lifeless	O
mass	O
has	O
already	O
grown	O
an	O
excrescent	O
power	,
which	O
tends	O
to	O
realize	O
all	O
the	O
dangers	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
apprehended	O
from	O
a	O
defective	O
construction	O
of	O
the	O
supreme	O
government	O
of	O
the	O
union	.
it	O
is	O
now	O
no	O
longer	O
a	O
point	O
of	O
speculation	O
and	O
hope	,
that	O
the	O
western	O
territory	O
is	O
a	O
mine	O
of	O
vast	O
wealth	O
to	O
the	O
united	O
states	;
and	O
although	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
nature	O
as	O
to	O
extricate	O
them	O
from	O
their	O
present	O
distresses	,
or	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
to	O
come	,
to	O
yield	O
any	O
regular	O
supplies	O
for	O
the	O
public	O
expenses	,
yet	O
must	O
it	O
hereafter	O
be	O
able	,
under	O
proper	O
management	,
both	O
to	O
effect	O
a	O
gradual	O
discharge	O
of	O
the	O
domestic	O
debt	,
and	O
to	O
furnish	,
for	O
a	O
certain	O
period	,
liberal	O
tributes	O
to	O
the	O
federal	O
treasury	.
a	O
very	O
large	O
proportion	O
of	O
this	O
fund	O
has	O
been	O
already	O
surrendered	O
by	O
individual	O
states	;
and	O
it	O
may	O
with	O
reason	O
be	O
expected	O
that	O
the	O
remaining	O
states	O
will	O
not	O
persist	O
in	O
withholding	O
similar	O
proofs	O
of	O
their	O
equity	O
and	O
generosity	.
we	O
may	O
calculate	,
therefore	,
that	O
a	O
rich	O
and	O
fertile	O
country	,
of	O
an	O
area	O
equal	O
to	O
the	O
inhabited	O
extent	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	,
will	O
soon	O
become	O
a	O
national	O
stock	.
congress	O
have	O
assumed	O
the	O
administration	O
of	O
this	O
stock	.
they	O
have	O
begun	O
to	O
render	O
it	O
productive	.
congress	O
have	O
undertaken	O
to	O
do	O
more	:
they	O
have	O
proceeded	O
to	O
form	O
new	O
states	,
to	O
erect	O
temporary	O
governments	,
to	O
appoint	O
officers	O
for	O
them	,
and	O
to	O
prescribe	O
the	O
conditions	O
on	O
which	O
such	O
states	O
shall	O
be	O
admitted	O
into	O
the	O
confederacy	.
all	O
this	O
has	O
been	O
done	;
and	O
done	O
without	O
the	O
least	O
color	O
of	O
constitutional	O
authority	.
yet	O
no	O
blame	O
has	O
been	O
whispered	;
no	O
alarm	O
has	O
been	O
sounded	.
a	O
great	O
and	O
independent	O
fund	O
of	O
revenue	O
is	O
passing	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
a	O
single	O
body	O
of	O
men	,
who	O
can	O
raise	O
troops	O
to	O
an	O

to	O
their	O
support	O
for	O
an	O
indefinite	O
period	O
of	O

there	O
are	O
men	,
who	O
have	O
not	O
only	O
been	O
silent	O
spectators	O
of	O
this	O
prospect	,
but	O
who	O
are	O
advocates	O
for	O
the	O
system	O
which	O
exhibits	O
it	;
and	,
at	O
the	O

time	,
urge	O
against	O
the	O
new	O
system	O
the	O
objections	O
which	O
we	O

would	O
they	O
not	O
act	O
with	O
more	O
consistency	,
in	O
urging	O
the	O
establishment	O
of	O
the	O
latter	,
as	O
no	O

necessary	O
to	O

the	O

against	O
the	O
future	O
powers	O
and	O
resources	O
of	O
a	O
body	O

from	O

the	O

the	O

but	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
fact	O
an	O
alarming	O
proof	O
of	O
the	O
danger	O

from	O
a	O
government	O
which	O
does	O
not	O
possess	O
regular	O
powers	O
commensurate	O
to	O

objects	?
a	O
dissolution	O
or	O
usurpation	O
is	O
the	O
dreadful	O
dilemma	O
to	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
continually	O
exposed	.

<bos>	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
new	O
york	:

<bos>	O
the	O
constitution	O
proposed	O
by	O
the	O
convention	O
may	O
be	O
considered	O
under	O
two	O
general	O
points	O
of	O
view	.
the	O
first	O
relates	O
to	O
the	O
sum	O
or	O
quantity	O
of	O
power	O
which	O
it	O
vests	O
in	O
the	O
government	,
including	O
the	O
restraints	O
imposed	O
on	O
the	O
states	.
the	O
second	,
to	O
the	O
particular	O
structure	O
of	O
the	O
government	,
and	O
the	O
distribution	O
of	O
this	O
power	O
among	O
its	O
several	O
branches	.

<bos>	O
under	O
the	O
first	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
subject	,
two	O
important	O
questions	O
arise	:

<bos>	O
this	O
method	O
of	O
handling	O
the	O
subject	O
can	O
not	O
impose	O
on	O
the	O
good	O
sense	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
america	.
it	O
may	O
display	O
the	O
subtlety	O
of	O
the	O
writer	;
it	O
may	O
open	O
a	O
boundless	O
field	O
for	O
rhetoric	O
and	O
declamation	;
it	O
may	O
inflame	O
the	O
passions	O
of	O
the	O
unthinking	,
and	O
may	O
confirm	O
the	O
prejudices	O
of	O
the	O
misthinking	:
but	O
cool	O
and	O
candid	O
people	O
will	O
at	O
once	O
reflect	,
that	O
the	O
purest	O
of	O
human	O
blessings	O
must	O
have	O
a	O
portion	O
of	O
alloy	O
in	O
them	;
that	O
the	O
choice	O
must	O
always	O
be	O
made	,
if	O
not	O
of	O
the	O
lesser	O
evil	,
at	O
least	O
of	O
the	O
greater	,
not	O
the	O
perfect	,
good	;
and	O
that	O
in	O
every	O
political	O
institution	,
a	O
power	O
to	O
advance	O
the	O
public	O
happiness	O
involves	O
a	O
discretion	O
which	O
may	O
be	O
misapplied	O
and	O
abused	.
they	O
will	O
see	,
therefore	,
that	O
in	O
all	O
cases	O
where	O
power	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
conferred	,
the	O
point	O
first	O
to	O
be	O
decided	O
is	,
whether	O
such	O
a	O
power	O
be	O
necessary	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
good	;
as	O
the	O
next	O
will	O
be	,
in	O
case	O
of	O
an	O
affirmative	O
decision	,
to	O
guard	O
as	O
effectually	O
as	O
possible	O
against	O
a	O
perversion	O
of	O
the	O
power	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
detriment	.

<bos>	O
that	O
we	O
may	O
form	O
a	O
correct	O
judgment	O
on	O
this	O
subject	,
it	O
will	O
be	O
proper	O
to	O
review	O
the	O
several	O
powers	O
conferred	O
on	O
the	O
government	O
of	O
the	O
union	;
and	O
that	O
this	O
may	O
be	O
the	O
more	O
conveniently	O
done	O
they	O
may	O
be	O
reduced	O
into	O
different	O
classes	O
as	O
they	O
relate	O
to	O
the	O
following	O
different	O
objects	:

<bos>	O
the	O
powers	O
falling	O
within	O
the	O
first	O
class	O
are	O
those	O
of	O
declaring	O
war	O
and	O
granting	O
letters	O
of	O
marque	;
of	O
providing	O
armies	O
and	O
fleets	;
of	O
regulating	O
and	O
calling	O
forth	O
the	O
militia	;
of	O
levying	O
and	O
borrowing	O
money	.
security	O
against	O
foreign	O
danger	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
primitive	O
objects	O
of	O
civil	O
society	.
it	O
is	O
an	O
avowed	O
and	O
essential	O
object	O
of	O
the	O
american	O
union	.
the	O
powers	O
requisite	O
for	O
attaining	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
effectually	O
confided	O
to	O
the	O
federal	O
councils	.
is	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
declaring	O
war	O
necessary	?
no	O
man	O
will	O
answer	O
this	O
question	O
in	O
the	O
negative	.
it	O
would	O
be	O
superfluous	,
therefore	,
to	O
enter	O
into	O
a	O
proof	O
of	O
the	O
affirmative	.
the	O
existing	O
confederation	O
establishes	O
this	O
power	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
ample	O
form	.
is	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
raising	O
armies	O
and	O
equipping	O
fleets	O
necessary	?
this	O
is	O
involved	O
in	O
the	O
foregoing	O
power	.
it	O
is	O
involved	O
in	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
self-defense	.
but	O
was	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
give	O
an	O
indefinite	O
power	O
of	O
raising	O
troops	,
as	O
well	O
as	O
providing	O
fleets	;
and	O
of	O
maintaining	O
both	O
in	O
peace	,
as	O
well	O
as	O
in	O
war	?
the	O
answer	O
to	O
these	O
questions	O
has	O
been	O
too	O
far	O
anticipated	O
in	O
another	O
place	O
to	O
admit	O
an	O
extensive	O
discussion	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
this	O
place	.
the	O
answer	O
indeed	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
obvious	O
and	O
conclusive	O
as	O
scarcely	O
to	O
justify	O
such	O
a	O
discussion	O
in	O
any	O
place	.
with	O
what	O
color	O
of	O
propriety	O
could	O
the	O
force	O
necessary	O
for	O
defense	O
be	O
limited	O
by	O
those	O
who	O
can	O
not	O
limit	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
offense	?
if	O
a	O
federal	O
constitution	O
could	O
chain	O
the	O
ambition	O
or	O
set	O
bounds	O
to	O
the	O
exertions	O
of	O
all	O
other	O
nations	,
then	O
indeed	O
might	O
it	O
prudently	O
chain	O
the	O
discretion	O
of	O
its	O
own	O
government	,
and	O
set	O
bounds	O
to	O
the	O
exertions	O
for	O
its	O
own	O
safety	.

<bos>	O
how	O
could	O
a	O
readiness	O
for	O
war	O
in	O
time	O
of	O
peace	O
be	O
safely	O
prohibited	,
unless	O
we	O
could	O
prohibit	,
in	O
like	O
manner	,
the	O
preparations	O
and	O
establishments	O
of	O
every	O
hostile	O
nation	?
the	O
means	O
of	O
security	O
can	O
only	O
be	O
regulated	O
by	O
the	O
means	O
and	O
the	O
danger	O
of	O
attack	.
they	O
will	,
in	O
fact	,
be	O
ever	O
determined	O
by	O
these	O
rules	,
and	O
by	O
no	O
others	.
it	O
is	O
in	O
vain	O
to	O
oppose	O
constitutional	O
barriers	O
to	O
the	O
impulse	O
of	O
self-preservation	.
it	O
is	O
worse	O
than	O
in	O
vain	;
because	O
it	O
plants	O
in	O
the	O
constitution	O
itself	O
necessary	O
usurpations	O
of	O
power	,
every	O
precedent	O
of	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
germ	O
of	O
unnecessary	O
and	O
multiplied	O
repetitions	.
if	O
one	O
nation	O
maintains	O
constantly	O
a	O
disciplined	O
army	,
ready	O
for	O
the	O
service	O
of	O
ambition	O
or	O
revenge	,
it	O
obliges	O
the	O
most	O
pacific	O
nations	O
who	O
may	O
be	O
within	O
the	O
reach	O
of	O
its	O
enterprises	O
to	O
take	O

the	O

precaution	O

a	O

added	.
i	O
will	O
not	O

the	O
observations	O

flatter	O
myself	O
have	O
placed	O
this	O

a	O
just	O

light	.
but	O
it	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
improper	O
to	O
take	O
notice	O
of	O
an	O
argument	O
against	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	,
which	O
has	O
been	O
drawn	O
from	O
the	O
policy	O
and	O
practice	O
of	O
great	O
britain	.
it	O
is	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
continuance	O
of	O
an	O
army	O
in	O
that	O
kingdom	O
requires	O
an	O
annual	O
vote	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	;
whereas	O
the	O
american	O
constitution	O
has	O
lengthened	O
this	O
critical	O
period	O
to	O
two	O
years	.
this	O
is	O
the	O
form	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
comparison	O
is	O
usually	O
stated	O
to	O
the	O
public	:
but	O
is	O
it	O
a	O
just	O
form	?
is	O
it	O
a	O
fair	O
comparison	?
does	O
the	O
british	O
constitution	O
restrain	O
the	O
parliamentary	O
discretion	O
to	O
one	O
year	?
does	O
the	O
american	O
impose	O
on	O
the	O
congress	O
appropriations	O
for	O
two	O
years	?
on	O
the	O
contrary	,
it	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
unknown	O
to	O
the	O
authors	O
of	O
the	O
fallacy	O
themselves	,
that	O
the	O
british	O
constitution	O
fixes	O
no	O
limit	O
whatever	O
to	O
the	O
discretion	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	,
and	O
that	O
the	O
american	O
ties	O
down	O
the	O
legislature	O
to	O
two	O
years	,
as	O
the	O
longest	O
admissible	O
term	.

<bos>	O
had	O
the	O
argument	O
from	O
the	O
british	O
example	O
been	O
truly	O
stated	,
it	O
would	O
have	O
stood	O
thus	:
the	O
term	O
for	O
which	O
supplies	O
may	O
be	O
appropriated	O
to	O
the	O
army	O
establishment	,
though	O
unlimited	O
by	O
the	O
british	O
constitution	,
has	O
nevertheless	,
in	O
practice	,
been	O
limited	O
by	O
parliamentary	O
discretion	O
to	O
a	O
single	O
year	.
now	,
if	O
in	O
great	O
britain	,
where	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
commons	O
is	O
elected	O
for	O
seven	O
years	;
where	O
so	O
great	O
a	O
proportion	O

the	O

the	O

a	O
power	O
to	O
make	O
appropriations	O
to	O
the	O

for	O
an	O

term	,
without	O
desiring	,
or	O
without	O
daring	,
to	O
extend	O
the	O
term	O
beyond	O

ought	O

to	O

that	O

elected	O
freely	O
by	O
the	O
whole	O

can	O

with	O
the	O
discretion	O
over	O
such	O
appropriations	,
expressly	O
limited	O
to	O
the	O
short	O
period	O
of	O
two	O

a	O
bad	O
cause	O
seldom	O

to	O

of	O
this	O
truth	,
the	O
management	O
of	O
the	O
opposition	O
to	O
the	O
federal	O
government	O
is	O
an	O
unvaried	O
exemplification	.

<bos>	O
but	O
among	O
all	O
the	O
blunders	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
committed	,
none	O
is	O
more	O
striking	O
than	O
the	O
attempt	O
to	O

on	O

side	O
the	O
prudent	O
jealousy	O
entertained	O
by	O
the	O

the	O
attempt	O
has	O
awakened	O
fully	O
the	O
public	O
attention	O
to	O
that	O
important	O
subject	;
and	O
has	O
led	O
to	O
investigations	O
which	O
must	O
terminate	O
in	O
a	O
thorough	O
and	O
universal	O
conviction	,

that	O

provided	O
the	O

of	O

the	O

it	O

not	O
be	O
doubted	O
that	O

be	O
a	O

of	O

that	O
for	O

it	O

be	O
a	O
principal	O
source	;
that	O
at	O
this	O

it	O
is	O
an	O
essential	O
one	.
but	O
we	O
may	O
form	O
very	O
mistaken	O
ideas	O
on	O
this	O
subject	,
if	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
call	O
to	O

in	O
our	O
calculations	,
that	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O

vary	O
with	O
the	O
variations	,
both	O
in	O
the	O

the	O
kind	O
of	O

and	O
that	O
these	O
variations	O
do	O
not	O
correspond	O
with	O
the	O

of	O

which	O
must	O
be	O
the	O
general	O
measure	O
of	O
the	O
public	O

as	O

as	O
agriculture	O
continues	O
the	O

the	O

here	O

the	O
more	O
extraordinary	,
as	O
it	O
appears	O
that	O

what	O

i	O
appeal	O
to	O
the	O
objectors	O
themselves	,
whether	O
they	O
would	O
in	O
that	O

that	O
unless	O
these	O

be	O
so	O

sides	,
that	O
the	O

it	O
will	O
not	O

that	O

is	O
of	O
an	O

nature	,

that	O
it	O

the	O
next	O

to	O
provide	O
some	O

security	O
for	O

what	O
this	O

to	O

the	O
great	O

will	O
it	O

the	O
boundaries	O
of	O

the	O

this	O

the	O
security	O
which	O

experience	O
assures	O
us	,
that	O
the	O
efficacy	O
of	O
the	O
provision	O
has	O
been	O
greatly	O
overrated	;
and	O
that	O
some	O
more	O

the	O

that	O
no	O

than	O
that	O
of	O

out	O
the	O

a	O
respect	O
for	O

to	O

that	O

flagrantly	O
violated	O
by	O

a	O
variety	O

of	O

be	O
imputable	O

circumstances	O
connected	O
with	O

but	O
the	O
greater	O
part	O
of	O
them	O
may	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
the	O
spontaneous	O
shoots	O
of	O
an	O
ill-constituted	O
government	.

<bos>	O
it	O
appears	,
also	,
that	O
the	O
executive	O
department	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
innocent	O
of	O
frequent	O
breaches	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	.
there	O
are	O
three	O
observations	,
however	,
which	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
on	O
this	O
head	:
first	,
a	O
great	O
proportion	O
of	O
the	O
instances	O
were	O
either	O
immediately	O
produced	O
by	O
the	O
necessities	O
of	O
the	O
war	,
or	O
recommended	O
by	O
congress	O
or	O
the	O
commander-in-chief	;
secondly	,
in	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
instances	,
they	O
conformed	O
either	O
to	O
the	O
declared	O
or	O
the	O
known	O
sentiments	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
department	;
thirdly	,
the	O
executive	O
department	O
of	O
pennsylvania	O
is	O
distinguished	O
from	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
states	O
by	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
members	O
composing	O
it	.
in	O
this	O
respect	,
it	O
has	O
as	O
much	O
affinity	O
to	O
a	O
legislative	O
assembly	O
as	O
to	O
an	O
executive	O
council	.
and	O
being	O
at	O
once	O
exempt	O
from	O
the	O
restraint	O
of	O
an	O
individual	O
responsibility	O
for	O
the	O
acts	O
of	O
the	O
body	,
and	O
deriving	O
confidence	O
from	O
mutual	O
example	O
and	O
joint	O
influence	,
unauthorized	O
measures	O
would	,
of	O
course	,
be	O
more	O
freely	O
hazarded	,
than	O
where	O
the	O
executive	O
department	O
is	O
administered	O
by	O
a	O
single	O
hand	,
or	O
by	O
a	O
few	O
hands	.

<bos>	O
the	O
conclusion	O
which	O
i	O
am	O
warranted	O
in	O
drawing	O
from	O
these	O
observations	O
is	,
that	O
a	O
mere	O
demarcation	O
on	O
parchment	O
of	O
the	O
constitutional	O
limits	O
of	O
the	O
several	O
departments	,
is	O
not	O
a	O
sufficient	O
guard	O
against	O
those	O
encroachments	O
which	O
lead	O
to	O
a	O
tyrannical	O
concentration	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
powers	O
of	O
government	O

the	O

but	O
as	O
the	O
ultimate	O
object	O
of	O
these	O
papers	O
is	O
to	O
determine	O
clearly	O
and	O
fully	O
the	O
merits	O
of	O
this	O
constitution	,
and	O
the	O
expediency	O
of	O
adopting	O
it	,
our	O
plan	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
complete	O
without	O
taking	O
a	O
more	O
critical	O
and	O
thorough	O
survey	O
of	O
the	O
work	O
of	O
the	O
convention	,
without	O
examining	O
it	O
on	O
all	O
its	O
sides	,
comparing	O
it	O
in	O
all	O
its	O
parts	,
and	O
calculating	O
its	O
probable	O
effects	.

<bos>	O
that	O
this	O
remaining	O
task	O
may	O
be	O
executed	O
under	O
impressions	O
conducive	O
to	O
a	O
just	O
and	O
fair	O
result	,
some	O
reflections	O
must	O
in	O
this	O
place	O
be	O
indulged	,
which	O
candor	O
previously	O
suggests	.

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
misfortune	,
inseparable	O
from	O
human	O
affairs	,
that	O
public	O
measures	O
are	O
rarely	O
investigated	O
with	O
that	O
spirit	O
of	O
moderation	O
which	O
is	O
essential	O
to	O
a	O
just	O
estimate	O
of	O
their	O
real	O
tendency	O
to	O
advance	O
or	O
obstruct	O
the	O
public	O
good	;
and	O
that	O
this	O
spirit	O
is	O
more	O
apt	O
to	O
be	O
diminished	O
than	O
promoted	,
by	O
those	O
occasions	O
which	O
require	O
an	O
unusual	O
exercise	O
of	O
it	.
to	O
those	O
who	O
have	O
been	O
led	O
by	O
experience	O
to	O
attend	O
to	O
this	O
consideration	,
it	O
could	O
not	O
appear	O
surprising	,
that	O
the	O
act	O
of	O
the	O
convention	,
which	O
recommends	O
so	O
many	O
important	O
changes	O
and	O
innovations	,
which	O
may	O
be	O
viewed	O
in	O
so	O

relations	,

which	O
touches	O
the	O
springs	O

of	O
its	O

in	O
some	,
it	O
has	O
been	O

evident	O
from	O

that	O
they	O
have	O
scanned	O

of	O

that	O

the	O

that	O

not	O

without	O
a	O
disposition	O
to	O

but	O
will	O
see	O
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
reflecting	,
that	O
a	O
faultless	O
plan	O
was	O
not	O
to	O

nor	O
will	O
they	O

make	O
allowances	O
for	O
the	O
errors	O
which	O
may	O
be	O
chargeable	O
on	O
the	O
fallibility	O
to	O
which	O
the	O
convention	,
as	O
a	O
body	O
of	O
men	,
were	O
liable	;
but	O
will	O
keep	O
in	O
mind	,
that	O
they	O
themselves	O
also	O
are	O
but	O
men	,
and	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
assume	O
an	O
infallibility	O
in	O
rejudging	O
the	O
fallible	O
opinions	O
of	O
others	.

<bos>	O
with	O
equal	O
readiness	O
will	O
it	O
be	O
perceived	,
that	O
besides	O
these	O
inducements	O
to	O

many	O

ought	O
to	O
be	O
made	O

<bos>	O
the	O

us	.
it	O
has	O
been	O
shown	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
these	O

that	O
the	O
existing	O
confederation	O
is	O
founded	O
on	O
principles	O
which	O
are	O
fallacious	;
that	O
we	O
must	O

change	O
this	O

and	O
with	O
it	O
the	O
superstructure	O
resting	O
upon	O
it	.
it	O
has	O
been	O
shown	,
that	O
the	O
other	O
confederacies	O
which	O
could	O
be	O
consulted	O
as	O
precedents	O
have	O
been	O
vitiated	O
by	O
the	O

principles	,
and	O
can	O
therefore	O
furnish	O
no	O
other	O
light	O
than	O
that	O
of	O

which	O
give	O

of	O
the	O
course	O
to	O
be	O
shunned	,
without	O
pointing	O
out	O
that	O
which	O

to	O

pursued	.
the	O
most	O
that	O
the	O
convention	O
could	O
do	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
situation	,
was	O
to	O
avoid	O
the	O
errors	O
suggested	O
by	O
the	O
past	O
experience	O
of	O
other	O
countries	,
as	O
well	O
as	O
of	O
our	O

and	O
to	O
provide	O
a	O

mode	O
of	O
rectifying	O
their	O

<bos>	O
among	O
the	O
difficulties	O

a	O

the	O

of	O

the	O
expectation	O
of	O
the	O

yet	O
that	O
it	O
could	O

by	O
no	O
one	O
who	O
is	O
unwilling	O
to	O

his	O
ignorance	O
of	O

energy	O
in	O

is	O

which	O
enter	O
into	O
the	O

stability	O
in	O

is	O
essential	O
to	O

to	O
the	O

an	O

more	O
an	O

in	O
itself	O
than	O
it	O
is	O
odious	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
pronounced	O
with	O
assurance	O
that	O
the	O

of	O
this	O

enlightened	O
as	O

are	O
with	O

to	O

on	O
comparing	,
however	,
these	O
valuable	O
ingredients	O
with	O
the	O
vital	O
principles	O
of	O

we	O
must	O
perceive	O
at	O
once	O
the	O
difficulty	O
of	O
mingling	O
them	O
together	O
in	O
their	O
due	O
proportions	.
the	O
genius	O
of	O
republican	O
liberty	O
seems	O
to	O
demand	O
on	O
one	O
side	,
not	O
only	O
that	O
all	O
power	O
should	O
be	O
derived	O
from	O
the	O
people	,
but	O
that	O
those	O
intrusted	O
with	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
kept	O
in	O
independence	O
on	O
the	O
people	,
by	O
a	O
short	O
duration	O
of	O
their	O
appointments	;
and	O
that	O
even	O
during	O
this	O
short	O
period	O
the	O
trust	O
should	O
be	O
placed	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
few	,
but	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
hands	.
stability	,
on	O
the	O
contrary	,
requires	O
that	O
the	O
hands	O
in	O
which	O
power	O
is	O
lodged	O
should	O
continue	O
for	O
a	O
length	O
of	O
time	O
the	O

a	O
frequent	O
change	O
of	O
men	O
will	O
result	O
from	O
a	O
frequent	O
return	O
of	O
elections	;
and	O
a	O
frequent	O
change	O
of	O
measures	O
from	O
a	O
frequent	O
change	O
of	O
men	:
whilst	O
energy	O
in	O
government	O
requires	O
not	O
only	O
a	O
certain	O
duration	O
of	O
power	,
but	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
it	O
by	O
a	O

the	O

to	O

<bos>	O
here	,

are	O
three	O

indistinctness	O
of	O

imperfection	O
of	O

of	O
conception	,
inadequateness	O
of	O
the	O

any	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
must	O

the	O

must	O
have	O

all	.

<bos>	O
to	O
the	O
difficulties	O
already	O
mentioned	O
may	O
be	O
added	O
the	O
interfering	O
pretensions	O
of	O
the	O
larger	O
and	O
smaller	O
states	.
we	O
can	O
not	O
err	O
in	O
supposing	O
that	O
the	O
former	O
would	O
contend	O
for	O
a	O
participation	O
in	O
the	O
government	,
fully	O
proportioned	O
to	O
their	O
superior	O
wealth	O
and	O
importance	;
and	O
that	O
the	O
latter	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
less	O
tenacious	O
of	O
the	O
equality	O
at	O
present	O
enjoyed	O
by	O
them	.
we	O
may	O
well	O
suppose	O
that	O
neither	O
side	O
would	O
entirely	O
yield	O
to	O
the	O
other	,
and	O
consequently	O
that	O
the	O
struggle	O
could	O
be	O
terminated	O
only	O
by	O
compromise	.
it	O
is	O
extremely	O
probable	,
also	,
that	O
after	O
the	O
ratio	O
of	O
representation	O
had	O
been	O
adjusted	,
this	O
very	O
compromise	O
must	O
have	O
produced	O
a	O
fresh	O
struggle	O
between	O
the	O
same	O
parties	,
to	O
give	O
such	O
a	O
turn	O
to	O
the	O
organization	O
of	O
the	O
government	,
and	O
to	O
the	O
distribution	O
of	O
its	O
powers	,
as	O
would	O
increase	O
the	O
importance	O
of	O
the	O
branches	,
in	O
forming	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
respectively	O
obtained	O
the	O
greatest	O
share	O
of	O
influence	.
there	O
are	O
features	O
in	O
the	O
constitution	O
which	O
warrant	O
each	O
of	O
these	O
suppositions	;
and	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
either	O
of	O
them	O
is	O
well	O
founded	,
it	O
shows	O
that	O
the	O
convention	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
compelled	O
to	O
sacrifice	O
theoretical	O
propriety	O
to	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
extraneous	O
considerations	.

<bos>	O
nor	O
could	O
it	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
large	O
and	O
small	O
states	O
only	,
which	O
would	O
marshal	O
themselves	O
in	O
opposition	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
on	O
various	O
points	.
other	O
combinations	,
resulting	O
from	O
a	O
difference	O
of	O
local	O
position	O
and	O
policy	,
must	O
have	O
created	O
additional	O
difficulties	.
as	O
every	O
state	O
may	O
be	O
divided	O
into	O
different	O
districts	,
and	O
its	O
citizens	O
into	O
different	O
classes	,
which	O
give	O
birth	O
to	O
contending	O
interests	O
and	O
local	O
jealousies	,
so	O
the	O
different	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
are	O
distinguished	O
from	O
each	O
other	O
by	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
circumstances	,
which	O
produce	O
a	O
like	O
effect	O
on	O
a	O
larger	O
scale	.
and	O
although	O
this	O
variety	O
of	O
interests	,
for	O
reasons	O
sufficiently	O
explained	O
in	O
a	O
former	O
paper	,
may	O
have	O
a	O
salutary	O
influence	O
on	O
the	O
administration	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
when	O
formed	,
yet	O
every	O
one	O
must	O
be	O
sensible	O
of	O
the	O
contrary	O
influence	,
which	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
experienced	O
in	O
the	O
task	O
of	O
forming	O
it	.

<bos>	O
would	O
it	O
be	O
wonderful	O
if	,
under	O
the	O
pressure	O
of	O
all	O
these	O
difficulties	,
the	O
convention	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
forced	O
into	O
some	O
deviations	O
from	O
that	O
artificial	O
structure	O
and	O
regular	O
symmetry	O
which	O
an	O
abstract	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
subject	O
might	O
lead	O
an	O
ingenious	O
theorist	O
to	O
bestow	O
on	O
a	O
constitution	O
planned	O
in	O
his	O
closet	O
or	O
in	O
his	O
imagination	?
the	O
real	O
wonder	O
is	O
that	O
so	O
many	O
difficulties	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
surmounted	,
and	O
surmounted	O
with	O
a	O
unanimity	O
almost	O
as	O
unprecedented	O
as	O
it	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
unexpected	.
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
for	O
any	O
man	O
of	O
candor	O
to	O
reflect	O
on	O
this	O
circumstance	O
without	O
partaking	O
of	O
the	O
astonishment	.
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
for	O
the	O
man	O
of	O
pious	O
reflection	O
not	O
to	O
perceive	O
in	O
it	O
a	O
finger	O
of	O
that	O
almighty	O
hand	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
so	O
frequently	O
and	O
signally	O
extended	O
to	O
our	O
relief	O
in	O
the	O
critical	O
stages	O
of	O
the	O
revolution	.

<bos>	O
we	O
had	O
occasion	,
in	O
a	O
former	O
paper	,
to	O
take	O
notice	O
of	O
the	O
repeated	O
trials	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
unsuccessfully	O
made	O
in	O
the	O
united	O
netherlands	O
for	O
reforming	O
the	O
baneful	O
and	O
notorious	O
vices	O
of	O
their	O
constitution	.
the	O
history	O
of	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O
great	O
councils	O
and	O
consultations	O
held	O
among	O
mankind	O
for	O
reconciling	O
their	O
discordant	O
opinions	,
assuaging	O
their	O
mutual	O
jealousies	,
and	O
adjusting	O
their	O
respective	O
interests	,
is	O
a	O
history	O
of	O
factions	,
contentions	,
and	O
disappointments	,
and	O
may	O
be	O
classed	O
among	O
the	O
most	O
dark	O
and	O
degraded	O
pictures	O
which	O
display	O
the	O
infirmities	O
and	O
depravities	O
of	O
the	O
human	O
character	.
if	,
in	O
a	O
few	O
scattered	O
instances	,
a	O
brighter	O
aspect	O
is	O
presented	,
they	O
serve	O
only	O
as	O
exceptions	O
to	O
admonish	O
us	O
of	O
the	O
general	O
truth	;
and	O
by	O
their	O
lustre	O
to	O
darken	O
the	O
gloom	O
of	O
the	O
adverse	O
prospect	O
to	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
contrasted	.
in	O
revolving	O
the	O
causes	O
from	O
which	O
these	O
exceptions	O
result	,
and	O
applying	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
particular	O
instances	O
before	O
us	,
we	O
are	O
necessarily	O
led	O
to	O
two	O
important	O
conclusions	.
the	O
first	O
is	,
that	O
the	O
convention	O
must	O
have	O
enjoyed	,
in	O
a	O
very	O
singular	O
degree	,
an	O
exemption	O
from	O
the	O
pestilential	O
influence	O
of	O
party	O
animosities	O
the	O
disease	O
most	O
incident	O
to	O
deliberative	O
bodies	,
and	O
most	O
apt	O
to	O
contaminate	O
their	O
proceedings	.
the	O
second	O
conclusion	O
is	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
deputations	O
composing	O
the	O
convention	O
were	O
satisfactorily	O
accommodated	O
by	O
the	O
final	O
act	,
or	O
were	O
induced	O
to	O
accede	O
to	O
it	O
by	O
a	O
deep	O
conviction	O
of	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
sacrificing	O
private	O
opinions	O
and	O
partial	O
interests	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
good	,
and	O
by	O
a	O
despair	O
of	O
seeing	O
this	O
necessity	O
diminished	O
by	O
delays	O
or	O
by	O
new	O
experiments	.

insulted	O

its	O

imputation	O

awe	O

influence	,
equally	O
dishonorable	O

dissatisfactory	O

this	O
consideration	O

so	O
many	O
obstacles	O

removal	O

further	O

the	O

whenever	O
the	O

may	O
choose	O
to	O

they	O
have	O
a	O
right	O
to	O
do	O
so	,

to	O
claim	O
the	O

for	O
the	O
latter	.
the	O
only	O
restriction	O
imposed	O
on	O
them	O
is	,
that	O
they	O
shall	O
not	O
exchange	O
republican	O

a	O
restriction	O
which	,
it	O
is	O

be	O
considered	O
as	O
a	O

the	O
latitude	O
of	O
the	O

here	O

seems	O
to	O
secure	O
each	O

against	O

the	O
history	,
both	O

proves	O
that	O
the	O

to	O
the	O

it	O
has	O
been	O
remarked	,
that	O
even	O
among	O
the	O
swiss	O

which	,

not	O

made	O
for	O
this	O
object	;
and	O
the	O
history	O
of	O
that	O
league	O
informs	O
us	O
that	O
mutual	O
aid	O
is	O
frequently	O
claimed	O
and	O
afforded	;
and	O
as	O
well	O
by	O
the	O
most	O
democratic	,
as	O
the	O
other	O

a	O
recent	O
and	O
well-known	O
event	O
among	O
ourselves	O
has	O
warned	O
us	O
to	O
be	O
prepared	O
for	O
emergencies	O
of	O
a	O
like	O
nature	.
at	O
first	O
view	,
it	O
might	O
seem	O
not	O
to	O
square	O
with	O
the	O
republican	O
theory	,
to	O
suppose	,
either	O
that	O
a	O
majority	O
have	O
not	O
the	O
right	,
or	O
that	O
a	O
minority	O
will	O
have	O
the	O
force	,
to	O
subvert	O
a	O
government	;
and	O
consequently	,
that	O
the	O
federal	O
interposition	O
can	O
never	O
be	O
required	,
but	O
when	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
improper	.
but	O
theoretic	O
reasoning	,
in	O
this	O
as	O
in	O
most	O
other	O
cases	,
must	O
be	O
qualified	O
by	O
the	O
lessons	O
of	O
practice	.
why	O
may	O
not	O
illicit	O
combinations	,
for	O
purposes	O
of	O
violence	,
be	O
formed	O
as	O
well	O
by	O
a	O
majority	O
of	O
a	O
state	,
especially	O
a	O
small	O

as	O
by	O
a	O

of	O
a	O

a	O

and	O
if	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
ought	,
in	O
the	O
latter	O
case	,
to	O
protect	O
the	O

ought	O
not	O
the	O
federal	O
authority	,
in	O
the	O
former	,
to	O
support	O
the	O
state	O
authority	?
besides	,
there	O
are	O
certain	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
constitutions	O
which	O
are	O
so	O
interwoven	O
with	O
the	O

that	O
a	O

communicating	O
the	O

the	O

insurrections	O
in	O
a	O

will	O
rarely	O
induce	O
a	O

them	O

some	O

it	O
will	O
be	O
much	O
better	O
that	O
the	O
violence	O
in	O
such	O
cases	O
should	O
be	O
repressed	O
by	O

be	O
left	O
to	O

by	O
a	O
bloody	O
and	O

contest	.
the	O
existence	O
of	O
a	O

will	O
generally	O

that	O

<bos>	O
we	O
have	O
seen	,
in	O
all	O
the	O
examples	O
of	O
ancient	O
and	O
modern	O
confederacies	,
the	O
strongest	O
tendency	O
continually	O
betraying	O
itself	O
in	O
the	O
members	,
to	O
despoil	O
the	O
general	O
government	O
of	O
its	O
authorities	,
with	O
a	O
very	O
ineffectual	O
capacity	O
in	O
the	O
latter	O
to	O
defend	O
itself	O
against	O
the	O
encroachments	.
although	,
in	O
most	O
of	O
these	O
examples	,
the	O
system	O
has	O
been	O
so	O
dissimilar	O
from	O
that	O
under	O
consideration	O
as	O
greatly	O
to	O
weaken	O
any	O
inference	O
concerning	O
the	O
latter	O
from	O
the	O
fate	O
of	O
the	O
former	,
yet	,
as	O
the	O

will	O
retain	,
under	O
the	O
proposed	O
constitution	,
a	O
very	O
extensive	O
portion	O
of	O
active	O

the	O
inference	O

not	O
to	O
be	O

in	O
the	O
achaean	O
league	O
it	O
is	O
probable	O
that	O
the	O
federal	O
head	O
had	O
a	O
degree	O
and	O
species	O
of	O
power	,
which	O
gave	O
it	O
a	O
considerable	O
likeness	O
to	O

framed	O

the	O
lycian	O
confederacy	,
as	O
far	O
as	O
its	O
principles	O
and	O
form	O
are	O
transmitted	,
must	O
have	O
borne	O
a	O
still	O
greater	O
analogy	O
to	O
it	.
yet	O
history	O
does	O
not	O
inform	O
us	O
that	O
either	O
of	O
them	O
ever	O
degenerated	,
or	O
tended	O
to	O
degenerate	,
into	O
one	O
consolidated	O
government	.
on	O
the	O
contrary	,
we	O
know	O
that	O
the	O
ruin	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
proceeded	O
from	O
the	O
incapacity	O
of	O
the	O
federal	O
authority	O
to	O
prevent	O
the	O
dissensions	,
and	O
finally	O
the	O
disunion	,
of	O
the	O
subordinate	O
authorities	.
these	O
cases	O
are	O
the	O
more	O
worthy	O
of	O
our	O
attention	,
as	O
the	O
external	O
causes	O
by	O
which	O
the	O
component	O
parts	O
were	O
pressed	O
together	O
were	O
much	O
more	O
numerous	O
and	O
powerful	O
than	O
in	O
our	O
case	;
and	O
consequently	O
less	O
powerful	O
ligaments	O
within	O
would	O
be	O
sufficient	O
to	O
bind	O
the	O

to	O
the	O

and	O
to	O
each	O
other	.

<bos>	O
in	O

we	O
have	O
seen	O
a	O

the	O

in	O

it	O

the	O
state	O

will	O
have	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
the	O

whether	O
we	O
compare	O
them	O
in	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

the	O

the	O

may	O
be	O
regarded	O
as	O
constituent	O
and	O
essential	O

thus	,
each	O
of	O
the	O

will	O
owe	O
its	O
existence	O
more	O

less	O
to	O
the	O
favor	O
of	O
the	O
state	O

which	O

more	O

it	O
is	O

that	O

the	O

<bos>	O
the	O

relating	O
to	O

that	O

be	O
to	O

at	O

that	O

<bos>	O
resuming	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
the	O
last	O
paper	,
i	O
proceed	O
to	O
inquire	O
whether	O
the	O
federal	O
government	O
or	O
the	O
state	O
governments	O
will	O
have	O
the	O
advantage	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
predilection	O
and	O
support	O
of	O
the	O
people	.
notwithstanding	O
the	O
different	O
modes	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
appointed	,
we	O
must	O
consider	O
both	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
substantially	O
dependent	O
on	O
the	O
great	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
citizens	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	.
i	O
assume	O
this	O
position	O
here	O
as	O
it	O
respects	O
the	O
first	,
reserving	O
the	O
proofs	O
for	O
another	O
place	.
the	O
federal	O
and	O
state	O
governments	O
are	O
in	O
fact	O
but	O
different	O
agents	O
and	O
trustees	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
constituted	O
with	O
different	O
powers	,
and	O
designed	O
for	O
different	O
purposes	.
the	O
adversaries	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
altogether	O
in	O
their	O
reasonings	O
on	O
this	O
subject	;
and	O
to	O
have	O
viewed	O
these	O
different	O
establishments	,
not	O
only	O
as	O
mutual	O
rivals	O
and	O
enemies	,
but	O
as	O
uncontrolled	O
by	O
any	O
common	O
superior	O
in	O
their	O
efforts	O
to	O
usurp	O
the	O
authorities	O
of	O
each	O
other	.
these	O
gentlemen	O
must	O
here	O
be	O
reminded	O
of	O
their	O
error	.
they	O
must	O
be	O
told	O
that	O
the	O
ultimate	O
authority	,
wherever	O
the	O
derivative	O
may	O
be	O
found	,
resides	O
in	O
the	O
people	O
alone	,
and	O
that	O
it	O
will	O
not	O
depend	O
merely	O
on	O
the	O
comparative	O
ambition	O
or	O
address	O
of	O
the	O
different	O
governments	,
whether	O
either	,
or	O
which	O
of	O
them	,
will	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
enlarge	O
its	O
sphere	O
of	O

at	O
the	O
expense	O
of	O

that	O
the	O

be	O
supposed	O
to	O

on	O
the	O

those	O

to	O

beyond	O
doubt	O
that	O
the	O
first	O
and	O
most	O
natural	O
attachment	O
of	O
the	O

will	O
be	O
to	O
the	O

the	O

of	O

a	O

the	O

very	O

in	O

with	O
what	O

hoped	O
under	O
a	O
better	O

during	O

and	O
particularly	O
whilst	O
the	O

was	O
in	O

an	O
activity	O
and	O
importance	O
as	O
great	O
as	O
it	O
can	O
well	O
have	O
in	O
any	O
future	O
circumstances	O
whatever	.
it	O
was	O
engaged	,
too	,
in	O
a	O
course	O
of	O
measures	O
which	O
had	O
for	O
their	O
object	O
the	O
protection	O
of	O
everything	O
that	O
was	O
dear	,
and	O
the	O
acquisition	O
of	O
everything	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
desirable	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
at	O
large	.

<bos>	O
it	O
was	,
nevertheless	,
invariably	O
found	,
after	O
the	O
transient	O
enthusiasm	O
for	O
the	O
early	O
congresses	O
was	O
over	,
that	O
the	O
attention	O
and	O
attachment	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
were	O
turned	O
anew	O
to	O
their	O
own	O
particular	O
governments	;
that	O
the	O
federal	O
council	O
was	O
at	O
no	O
time	O
the	O
idol	O
of	O
popular	O
favor	;
and	O
that	O
opposition	O
to	O
proposed	O
enlargements	O
of	O
its	O
powers	O
and	O
importance	O
was	O
the	O
side	O
usually	O
taken	O
by	O
the	O
men	O
who	O
wished	O
to	O
build	O
their	O
political	O
consequence	O
on	O
the	O
prepossessions	O
of	O
their	O
fellow-citizens	.
if	,
therefore	,
as	O
has	O
been	O
elsewhere	O
remarked	,
the	O
people	O
should	O
in	O
future	O
become	O
more	O
partial	O
to	O
the	O
federal	O
than	O
to	O
the	O
state	O
governments	,
the	O
change	O
can	O
only	O
result	O
from	O
such	O
manifest	O
and	O
irresistible	O
proofs	O
of	O
a	O
better	O
administration	,
as	O
will	O
overcome	O
all	O
their	O
antecedent	O
propensities	.
and	O
in	O
that	O
case	,
the	O
people	O
ought	O
not	O
surely	O
to	O
be	O
precluded	O
from	O
giving	O
most	O
of	O
their	O
confidence	O
where	O
they	O
may	O
discover	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
most	O
due	;
but	O
even	O
in	O
that	O
case	O
the	O
state	O
governments	O
could	O
have	O
little	O
to	O
apprehend	,
because	O
it	O
is	O
only	O
within	O
a	O
certain	O
sphere	O
that	O
the	O
federal	O
power	O
can	,
in	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
things	,
be	O
advantageously	O
administered	.
the	O
remaining	O
points	O
on	O
which	O
i	O
propose	O
to	O
compare	O
the	O
federal	O
and	O
state	O
governments	,
are	O
the	O
disposition	O
and	O
the	O
faculty	O
they	O
may	O
respectively	O
possess	,
to	O
resist	O
and	O
frustrate	O
the	O
measures	O
of	O
each	O
other	.
it	O
has	O
been	O
already	O
proved	O
that	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
federal	O
will	O
be	O
more	O
dependent	O
on	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
governments	,
than	O
the	O
latter	O
will	O
be	O
on	O
the	O
former	.

<bos>	O
it	O
has	O
appeared	O
also	,
that	O
the	O
prepossessions	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
on	O
whom	O
both	O
will	O
depend	,
will	O
be	O
more	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O

than	O
of	O
the	O

so	O

as	O
the	O
disposition	O

the	O

may	O
be	O
influenced	O
by	O
these	O
causes	,
the	O
state	O

must	O
clearly	O
have	O
the	O
advantage	.
but	O
in	O
a	O
distinct	O
and	O
very	O
important	O
point	O
of	O
view	,
the	O
advantage	O
will	O
lie	O
on	O
the	O

the	O
prepossessions	,
which	O
the	O
members	O
themselves	O
will	O
carry	O
into	O
the	O
federal	O

will	O
generally	O
be	O
favorable	O
to	O

whilst	O
it	O
will	O
rarely	O
happen	,
that	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
the	O

will	O
carry	O
into	O
the	O
public	O
councils	O
a	O
bias	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
the	O
general	O
government	.
a	O
local	O
spirit	O
will	O
infallibly	O
prevail	O
much	O
more	O
in	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
congress	,
than	O
a	O
national	O
spirit	O
will	O
prevail	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

<bos>	O
every	O

that	O
a	O
great	O
proportion	O
of	O
the	O
errors	O
committed	O
by	O
the	O
state	O

proceeds	O
from	O
the	O
disposition	O
of	O
the	O

to	O
sacrifice	O
the	O
comprehensive	O

permanent	O
interest	O
of	O

sufficiently	O
enlarge	O
their	O

to	O

the	O

it	O

that	O

the	O

that	O
the	O

will	O
be	O

of	O

that	O

still	O
it	O

that	O

a	O

can	O
be	O

in	O

not	O
exceed	O
one	O

this	O

an	O

more	O
than	O
twenty-five	O
or	O
thirty	O

to	O

would	O

it	O
may	O
well	O
be	O
doubted	,
whether	O
a	O
militia	O
thus	O
circumstanced	O
could	O
ever	O
be	O
conquered	O
by	O
such	O
a	O
proportion	O

acquainted	O
with	O
the	O
last	O
successful	O
resistance	O
of	O
this	O
country	O
against	O

will	O
be	O
most	O
inclined	O
to	O
deny	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
it	.

the	O
advantage	O

by	O
which	O
the	O

a	O
barrier	O
against	O
the	O
enterprises	O
of	O

more	O
insurmountable	O
than	O
any	O
which	O
a	O
simple	O

of	O
any	O

can	O
admit	O
of	.
notwithstanding	O
the	O

in	O

which	O
are	O
carried	O
as	O

as	O
the	O

the	O
governments	O
are	O
afraid	O
to	O
trust	O
the	O
people	O
with	O
arms	.
and	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
certain	,
that	O
with	O
this	O
aid	O
alone	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
able	O
to	O

to	O

of	O
local	O

of	O

by	O

attached	O
both	O
to	O
them	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
militia	,
it	O
may	O
be	O
affirmed	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
assurance	,
that	O
the	O
throne	O
of	O
every	O
tyranny	O
in	O
europe	O
would	O
be	O
speedily	O
overturned	O
in	O

of	O
the	O

it	.

<bos>	O
let	O
us	O
not	O
insult	O
the	O
free	O
and	O
gallant	O
citizens	O
of	O
america	O
with	O
the	O
suspicion	,
that	O
they	O
would	O

to	O
defend	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
in	O
actual	O
possession	,
than	O
the	O

be	O
to	O
rescue	O
theirs	O
from	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O

oppressors	.
let	O
us	O
rather	O
no	O
longer	O
insult	O
them	O
with	O
the	O
supposition	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
ever	O
reduce	O
themselves	O
to	O
the	O
necessity	O

the	O

under	O
the	O
present	O

may	O
be	O
put	O
into	O
a	O
very	O

form	,
which	O

altogether	O
conclusive	.
either	O
the	O
mode	O
in	O

supposition	,

the	O

they	O
seem	O
to	O
amount	O
to	O
the	O
most	O

evidence	,
that	O
the	O
powers	O
proposed	O
to	O

are	O
as	O
little	O

<bos>	O
a	O
fifth	O
class	O
of	O
provisions	O
in	O

consists	O
of	O
the	O

on	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
several	O

<bos>	O
``	O
the	O
prohibition	O
against	O
treaties	,

makes	O
a	O
part	O
of	O

and	O
for	O
reasons	O
which	O
need	O

copied	O
into	O
the	O

the	O
prohibition	O
of	O
letters	O
of	O

another	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
old	O

is	O
somewhat	O
extended	O
in	O
the	O
new	.
according	O
to	O
the	O
former	,
letters	O
of	O
marque	O
could	O
be	O
granted	O
by	O
the	O
states	O
after	O
a	O
declaration	O
of	O
war	;
according	O
to	O
the	O
latter	,
these	O
licenses	O
must	O
be	O
obtained	,
as	O

this	O

to	O

this	O

bulwark	O
in	O

i	O

the	O

they	O
very	O
rightly	O
infer	,
therefore	,
that	O
some	O
thorough	O
reform	O

the	O

<bos>	O
``	O
few	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	O
have	O

assailed	O

this	;

on	O
a	O

of	O
it	,
no	O

without	O
the	O

to	O
the	O
article	,
therefore	,
as	O
a	O
part	O

the	O

can	O
only	O
mean	O
that	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
the	O

improper	.
but	O
have	O
they	O
considered	O
whether	O
a	O
better	O
form	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
substituted	?
there	O
are	O
four	O
other	O
possible	O
methods	O
which	O
the	O
constitution	O
might	O
have	O
taken	O
on	O
this	O

they	O
might	O
have	O
copied	O
the	O
second	O
article	O
of	O

confederation	,
which	O
would	O
have	O
prohibited	O
the	O
exercise	O
of	O
any	O
power	O
not	O

delegated	;
they	O
might	O

attempted	O
a	O

enumeration	O
of	O
the	O
powers	O

under	O
the	O

``	O

negative	O
enumeration	O
of	O
them	,
by	O
specifying	O
the	O
powers	O

from	O

they	O

<bos>	O
had	O
the	O
convention	O
taken	O
the	O
first	O
method	O
of	O
adopting	O
the	O
second	O
article	O
of	O
confederation	,
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
the	O
new	O
congress	O
would	O
be	O
continually	O
exposed	,
as	O
their	O
predecessors	O
have	O
been	,
to	O
the	O
alternative	O
of	O
construing	O
the	O
term	O
``	O
expressly	O
''	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
rigor	,
as	O
to	O
disarm	O
the	O
government	O
of	O
all	O
real	O
authority	O
whatever	,
or	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
latitude	O
as	O
to	O
destroy	O
altogether	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
the	O
restriction	.
it	O
would	O
be	O
easy	O
to	O
show	,
if	O
it	O
were	O
necessary	,
that	O
no	O
important	O
power	,
delegated	O
by	O
the	O
articles	O
of	O
confederation	,
has	O
been	O
or	O
can	O
be	O
executed	O
by	O
congress	,
without	O
recurring	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
to	O
the	O
doctrine	O
of	O
construction	O
or	O
implication	.
as	O
the	O
powers	O
delegated	O
under	O
the	O
new	O
system	O
are	O
more	O
extensive	,
the	O
government	O
which	O
is	O
to	O
administer	O
it	O
would	O
find	O
itself	O
still	O
more	O
distressed	O
with	O
the	O
alternative	O
of	O
betraying	O
the	O
public	O
interests	O
by	O
doing	O
nothing	,
or	O
of	O
violating	O
the	O
constitution	O
by	O
exercising	O
powers	O
indispensably	O
necessary	O
and	O
proper	,
but	,
at	O
the	O

time	,
not	O
expressly	O
granted	.

<bos>	O
had	O
the	O
convention	O
attempted	O
a	O
positive	O
enumeration	O
of	O
the	O
powers	O
necessary	O
and	O
proper	O
for	O
carrying	O
their	O
other	O
powers	O
into	O
effect	,
the	O
attempt	O
would	O
have	O
involved	O
a	O
complete	O
digest	O
of	O
laws	O
on	O
every	O
subject	O
to	O
which	O
the	O
constitution	O
relates	;
accommodated	O
too	,
not	O
only	O
to	O
the	O
existing	O
state	O
of	O
things	,
but	O
to	O
all	O
the	O
possible	O
changes	O
which	O
futurity	O
may	O
produce	;
for	O
in	O
every	O
new	O
application	O
of	O
a	O
general	O
power	,
the	O
particular	O
powers	,
which	O
are	O
the	O
means	O
of	O
attaining	O
the	O
object	O
of	O
the	O
general	O
power	,
must	O
always	O
necessarily	O
vary	O
with	O
that	O
object	,
and	O
be	O
often	O
properly	O
varied	O
whilst	O
the	O
object	O
remains	O
the	O
same	.

had	O
they	O

not	O
necessary	O
or	O
proper	O
for	O
carrying	O
the	O
general	O
powers	O
into	O
execution	,
the	O
task	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
no	O
less	O
chimerical	;
and	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
liable	O
to	O
this	O
further	O
objection	,
that	O
every	O
defect	O
in	O
the	O
enumeration	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
equivalent	O
to	O
a	O
positive	O
grant	O
of	O
authority	.
if	,
to	O
avoid	O
this	O
consequence	,
they	O
had	O
attempted	O
a	O
partial	O
enumeration	O
of	O
the	O
exceptions	,
and	O
described	O
the	O
residue	O
by	O
the	O
general	O
terms	,
not	O
necessary	O
or	O
proper	,
it	O
must	O
have	O
happened	O
that	O
the	O
enumeration	O
would	O
comprehend	O
a	O
few	O
of	O
the	O
excepted	O
powers	O
only	;
that	O
these	O
would	O
be	O
such	O
as	O
would	O
be	O
least	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
assumed	O
or	O
tolerated	,
because	O
the	O
enumeration	O
would	O
of	O
course	O
select	O
such	O
as	O
would	O
be	O
least	O
necessary	O
or	O
proper	;
and	O
that	O
the	O
unnecessary	O
and	O
improper	O
powers	O
included	O
in	O
the	O
residuum	,

be	O
less	O
forcibly	O

than	O
if	O
no	O
partial	O
enumeration	O
had	O
been	O
made	.
had	O
the	O
constitution	O
been	O
silent	O
on	O
this	O
head	,
there	O
can	O
be	O
no	O
doubt	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
particular	O
powers	O
requisite	O
as	O
means	O
of	O
executing	O
the	O
general	O
powers	O
would	O
have	O
resulted	O
to	O

no	O
axiom	O
is	O
more	O
clearly	O
established	O
in	O

in	O
reason	,
than	O
that	O
wherever	O
the	O
end	O
is	O
required	,
the	O
means	O
are	O
authorized	;
wherever	O
a	O
general	O
power	O
to	O
do	O
a	O
thing	O
is	O
given	,
every	O
particular	O
power	O
necessary	O

it	O
is	O
included	.
had	O
this	O
last	O
method	,

been	O
pursued	O
by	O
the	O
convention	,
every	O
objection	O
now	O
urged	O
against	O
their	O
plan	O
would	O
remain	O
in	O
all	O
its	O
plausibility	;
and	O
the	O
real	O
inconveniency	O
would	O
be	O
incurred	O
of	O
not	O
removing	O
a	O
pretext	O
which	O
may	O
be	O
seized	O
on	O
critical	O
occasions	O
for	O
drawing	O
into	O
question	O
the	O
essential	O
powers	O
of	O
the	O
union	.
if	O
it	O
be	O
asked	O
what	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
consequence	,
in	O
case	O
the	O
congress	O
shall	O
misconstrue	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	,
and	O
exercise	O
powers	O
not	O
warranted	O
by	O
its	O
true	O
meaning	,
i	O
answer	,
the	O
same	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
should	O
misconstrue	O
or	O
enlarge	O
any	O
other	O
power	O
vested	O
in	O
them	;
as	O
if	O
the	O
general	O
power	O
had	O
been	O
reduced	O
to	O
particulars	,
and	O
any	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
violated	;
the	O
same	,
in	O
short	,
as	O
if	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	O
should	O
violate	O
the	O
irrespective	O
constitutional	O
authorities	.
in	O
the	O
first	O
instance	,
the	O
success	O
of	O
the	O
usurpation	O
will	O
depend	O
on	O
the	O
executive	O
and	O
judiciary	O
departments	,
which	O
are	O
to	O
expound	O
and	O
give	O
effect	O
to	O
the	O
legislative	O
acts	;
and	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
resort	O
a	O
remedy	O
must	O
be	O
obtained	O
from	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
can	,
by	O
the	O
election	O
of	O
more	O
faithful	O
representatives	,
annul	O
the	O
acts	O
of	O
the	O
usurpers	.

<bos>	O
the	O
truth	O
is	,
that	O
this	O
ultimate	O
redress	O
may	O
be	O
more	O
confided	O
in	O
against	O
unconstitutional	O
acts	O
of	O
the	O
federal	O
than	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	,
for	O
this	O
plain	O
reason	,
that	O
as	O
every	O
such	O
act	O
of	O
the	O
former	O
will	O
be	O
an	O
invasion	O
of	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
the	O
latter	,
these	O
will	O
be	O
ever	O
ready	O
to	O
mark	O
the	O
innovation	,
to	O
sound	O
the	O
alarm	O
to	O
the	O
people	,
and	O
to	O
exert	O
their	O
local	O
influence	O
in	O
effecting	O
a	O
change	O
of	O
federal	O
representatives	.
there	O
being	O
no	O
such	O
intermediate	O
body	O
between	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	O
and	O
the	O
people	O
interested	O
in	O
watching	O
the	O
conduct	O
of	O
the	O
former	,
violations	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
constitutions	O
are	O
more	O
likely	O
to	O
remain	O
unnoticed	O
and	O

<bos>	O
in	O
the	O
third	O
place	,
as	O
the	O
constitutions	O
of	O
the	O
states	O
differ	O
much	O
from	O
each	O
other	,
it	O
might	O
happen	O
that	O
a	O
treaty	O
or	O
national	O
law	,
of	O
great	O
and	O
equal	O
importance	O
to	O
the	O
states	,
would	O
interfere	O
with	O
some	O
and	O
not	O
with	O

and	O
would	O
consequently	O
be	O
valid	O

of	O

that	O
it	O
would	O

no	O

in	O
fine	,
the	O

founded	O
on	O
an	O
inversion	O
of	O

if	O
well	O
supported	,
would	O
have	O
great	O
weight	.
the	O
following	O
observations	O
will	O
show	O
that	,
like	O
most	O
other	O
objections	O
against	O
the	O
constitution	,
it	O
can	O
only	O
proceed	O
from	O
a	O
partial	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
subject	,
or	O
from	O
a	O
jealousy	O
which	O
discolors	O
and	O
disfigures	O
every	O
object	O
which	O
is	O
beheld	.

<bos>	O
those	O
who	O
urge	O
the	O
objection	O
seem	O
not	O
to	O
have	O
recollected	O
that	O
the	O
federal	O
constitution	O
will	O
not	O
suffer	O
by	O
a	O
comparison	O
with	O
the	O
state	O
constitutions	,
in	O
the	O
security	O
provided	O
for	O
a	O
gradual	O
augmentation	O
of	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
representatives	.
the	O
number	O
which	O
is	O
to	O
prevail	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
instance	O
is	O
declared	O
to	O
be	O
temporary	.
its	O
duration	O
is	O
limited	O
to	O
the	O
short	O
term	O
of	O
three	O
years	.
within	O
every	O
successive	O
term	O
of	O
ten	O
years	O
a	O
census	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
repeated	.
the	O
unequivocal	O
objects	O
of	O
these	O
regulations	O
are	,
first	,
to	O
readjust	,
from	O
time	O
to	O
time	,
the	O
apportionment	O
of	O
representatives	O
to	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
inhabitants	,
under	O
the	O
single	O
exception	O
that	O
each	O
state	O
shall	O
have	O
one	O
representative	O
at	O
least	;
secondly	,
to	O
augment	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
representatives	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
periods	,
under	O
the	O
sole	O
limitation	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
number	O
shall	O
not	O
exceed	O
one	O
for	O
every	O
thirty	O
thousand	O
inhabitants	.
if	O
we	O
review	O
the	O
constitutions	O
of	O
the	O
several	O
states	,
we	O
shall	O
find	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
contain	O
no	O
determinate	O
regulations	O
on	O
this	O
subject	,
that	O
others	O
correspond	O
pretty	O
much	O
on	O
this	O
point	O
with	O
the	O
federal	O
constitution	,
and	O
that	O
the	O
most	O
effectual	O
security	O
in	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
is	O
resolvable	O
into	O
a	O
mere	O
directory	O
provision	.

<bos>	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
experience	O
has	O
taken	O
place	O
on	O
this	O
subject	,
a	O
gradual	O
increase	O
of	O
representatives	O
under	O
the	O
state	O
constitutions	O
has	O
at	O
least	O
kept	O
pace	O
with	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
constituents	,
and	O
it	O
appears	O
that	O
the	O
former	O
have	O
been	O
as	O
ready	O
to	O
concur	O
in	O
such	O
measures	O
as	O
the	O
latter	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
call	O
for	O
them	.

<bos>	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
peculiarity	O
in	O
the	O
federal	O
constitution	O
which	O
insures	O
a	O
watchful	O
attention	O
in	O
a	O
majority	O
both	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
and	O
of	O
their	O
representatives	O
to	O
a	O
constitutional	O
augmentation	O
of	O
the	O
latter	.
the	O
peculiarity	O
lies	O
in	O
this	,
that	O
one	O
branch	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	O
is	O
a	O
representation	O
of	O
citizens	,
the	O
other	O
of	O
the	O
states	:
in	O
the	O
former	,
consequently	,
the	O
larger	O
states	O
will	O
have	O
most	O
weight	;
in	O
the	O
latter	,
the	O
advantage	O
will	O
be	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
the	O
smaller	O
states	.
from	O
this	O
circumstance	O
it	O
may	O
with	O
certainty	O
be	O
inferred	O
that	O
the	O
larger	O
states	O
will	O
be	O
strenuous	O
advocates	O
for	O
increasing	O
the	O
number	O
and	O
weight	O
of	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	O
in	O
which	O
their	O
influence	O
predominates	.
and	O
it	O
so	O
happens	O
that	O
four	O
only	O
of	O
the	O
largest	O
will	O
have	O
a	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
votes	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	.

<bos>	O
should	O
the	O
representatives	O
or	O
people	,
therefore	,
of	O
the	O
smaller	O
states	O
oppose	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
a	O
reasonable	O
addition	O
of	O
members	,
a	O
coalition	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
few	O
states	O
will	O
be	O
sufficient	O
to	O
overrule	O
the	O
opposition	;
a	O
coalition	O
which	,
notwithstanding	O
the	O
rivalship	O
and	O
local	O
prejudices	O
which	O
might	O
prevent	O
it	O
on	O
ordinary	O
occasions	,
would	O
not	O
fail	O
to	O
take	O
place	,
when	O
not	O
merely	O
prompted	O
by	O
common	O
interest	,
but	O
justified	O
by	O
equity	O
and	O
the	O
principles	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	.
it	O
may	O
be	O
alleged	,
perhaps	,
that	O
the	O
senate	O
would	O
be	O
prompted	O
by	O
like	O
motives	O
to	O
an	O
adverse	O
coalition	;
and	O
as	O
their	O
concurrence	O
would	O
be	O
indispensable	,
the	O
just	O
and	O
constitutional	O
views	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
branch	O
might	O
be	O
defeated	.
this	O
is	O
the	O
difficulty	O
which	O
has	O
probably	O
created	O
the	O
most	O
serious	O
apprehensions	O
in	O
the	O
jealous	O
friends	O
of	O
a	O
numerous	O
representation	.
fortunately	O
it	O
is	O
among	O
the	O
difficulties	O
which	,
existing	O
only	O
in	O
appearance	,
vanish	O
on	O
a	O
close	O
and	O
accurate	O
inspection	.
the	O
following	O
reflections	O
will	,
if	O
i	O
mistake	O
not	,
be	O
admitted	O
to	O
be	O
conclusive	O
and	O
satisfactory	O
on	O
this	O
point	.
notwithstanding	O
the	O
equal	O
authority	O
which	O
will	O
subsist	O
between	O
the	O
two	O
houses	O
on	O
all	O
legislative	O
subjects	,
except	O
the	O
originating	O
of	O
money	O
bills	,
it	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
doubted	O
that	O
the	O
house	,
composed	O
of	O
the	O
greater	O
number	O
of	O
members	,
when	O
supported	O
by	O
the	O
more	O
powerful	O
states	,
and	O
speaking	O
the	O
known	O
and	O
determined	O
sense	O
of	O
a	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
will	O
have	O
no	O
small	O
advantage	O
in	O
a	O
question	O
depending	O
on	O
the	O
comparative	O
firmness	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
houses	.

<bos>	O
this	O
advantage	O
must	O
be	O
increased	O
by	O
the	O
consciousness	,
felt	O
by	O
the	O
same	O
side	O
of	O
being	O
supported	O
in	O
its	O
demands	O
by	O
right	,
by	O
reason	,
and	O
by	O
the	O
constitution	;
and	O
the	O
consciousness	,
on	O
the	O
opposite	O
side	,
of	O
contending	O
against	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
all	O
these	O
solemn	O
considerations	.
it	O
is	O
farther	O
to	O
be	O
considered	,
that	O
in	O
the	O
gradation	O
between	O
the	O
smallest	O
and	O
largest	O
states	,
there	O
are	O
several	,
which	,
though	O
most	O
likely	O
in	O
general	O
to	O
arrange	O
themselves	O
among	O
the	O
former	O
are	O
too	O
little	O
removed	O
in	O
extent	O
and	O
population	O
from	O
the	O
latter	,
to	O
second	O
an	O
opposition	O
to	O
their	O
just	O
and	O
legitimate	O
pretensions	.
hence	O
it	O
is	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
certain	O
that	O
a	O
majority	O
of	O
votes	,
even	O
in	O
the	O
senate	,
would	O
be	O
unfriendly	O
to	O
proper	O
augmentations	O
in	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
representatives	.
it	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
looking	O
too	O
far	O
to	O
add	,
that	O
the	O
senators	O
from	O
all	O
the	O
new	O
states	O
may	O
be	O
gained	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
just	O
views	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	,
by	O
an	O
expedient	O
too	O
obvious	O
to	O
be	O
overlooked	.
as	O
these	O
states	O
will	,
for	O
a	O
great	O
length	O
of	O
time	,
advance	O
in	O
population	O
with	O
peculiar	O
rapidity	,
they	O
will	O
be	O
interested	O
in	O
frequent	O
reapportionments	O
of	O
the	O
representatives	O
to	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
inhabitants	.
the	O
large	O
states	,
therefore	,
who	O
will	O
prevail	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	,
will	O
have	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
to	O
make	O
reapportionments	O
and	O
augmentations	O
mutually	O
conditions	O
of	O
each	O
other	;
and	O
the	O
senators	O
from	O
all	O
the	O
most	O
growing	O
states	O
will	O
be	O
bound	O
to	O
contend	O
for	O
the	O
latter	,
by	O
the	O
interest	O
which	O
their	O
states	O
will	O
feel	O
in	O
the	O
former	.
these	O
considerations	O
seem	O
to	O
afford	O
ample	O
security	O
on	O
this	O
subject	,
and	O
ought	O
alone	O
to	O
satisfy	O
all	O
the	O
doubts	O
and	O
fears	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
indulged	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
it	.
admitting	,
however	,
that	O
they	O
should	O
all	O
be	O
insufficient	O
to	O
subdue	O
the	O
unjust	O
policy	O
of	O
the	O
smaller	O
states	,
or	O
their	O
predominant	O
influence	O
in	O
the	O
councils	O
of	O
the	O
senate	,
a	O
constitutional	O
and	O
infallible	O
resource	O
still	O
remains	O
with	O
the	O
larger	O
states	,
by	O
which	O
they	O
will	O
be	O
able	O
at	O
all	O
times	O
to	O
accomplish	O
their	O
just	O
purposes	.

<bos>	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	O
can	O
not	O
only	O
refuse	,
but	O
they	O
alone	O
can	O
propose	,
the	O
supplies	O
requisite	O
for	O
the	O
support	O
of	O
government	.
they	,
in	O
a	O
word	,
hold	O
the	O
purse	O
that	O
powerful	O
instrument	O
by	O
which	O
we	O
behold	,
in	O
the	O
history	O
of	O
the	O
british	O
constitution	,
an	O
infant	O
and	O
humble	O
representation	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
gradually	O
enlarging	O
the	O
sphere	O
of	O
its	O
activity	O
and	O
importance	,
and	O
finally	O
reducing	,
as	O
far	O
as	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
have	O
wished	,
all	O
the	O
overgrown	O
prerogatives	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
branches	O
of	O
the	O
government	.
this	O
power	O
over	O
the	O
purse	O
may	,
in	O
fact	,
be	O
regarded	O
as	O
the	O
most	O
complete	O
and	O
effectual	O
weapon	O
with	O
which	O
any	O
constitution	O
can	O
arm	O
the	O
immediate	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
for	O
obtaining	O
a	O
redress	O
of	O
every	O
grievance	,
and	O
for	O
carrying	O
into	O
effect	O
every	O
just	O
and	O
salutary	O
measure	.
but	O
will	O
not	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	O
be	O
as	O
much	O
interested	O
as	O
the	O
senate	O
in	O
maintaining	O
the	O
government	O
in	O
its	O
proper	O
functions	,
and	O
will	O
they	O
not	O
therefore	O
be	O
unwilling	O
to	O
stake	O
its	O
existence	O
or	O
its	O
reputation	O
on	O
the	O
pliancy	O
of	O
the	O
senate	?
or	,
if	O
such	O
a	O
trial	O
of	O
firmness	O
between	O
the	O
two	O
branches	O
were	O
hazarded	,
would	O
not	O
the	O
one	O
be	O
as	O
likely	O
first	O
to	O
yield	O
as	O
the	O

these	O
questions	O
will	O
create	O
no	O

with	O
those	O
who	O

the	O
more	O

be	O
the	O

<bos>	O
one	O
observation	,
however	,
i	O
must	O
be	O
permitted	O
to	O
add	O
on	O
this	O
subject	O
as	O
claiming	,
in	O
my	O
judgment	,
a	O
very	O
serious	O
attention	.
it	O
is	,
that	O
in	O
all	O
legislative	O
assemblies	O
the	O
greater	O
the	O
number	O
composing	O

may	O
be	,
the	O

an	O

may	O
be	,
of	O
whatever	O

the	O
greater	O
is	O
known	O
to	O

the	O
ascendency	O
of	O

in	O
the	O
next	O

the	O

the	O

on	O
characters	O

that	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

are	O

to	O

with	O

in	O
the	O
ancient	O

that	O

that	O

it	O
will	O
be	O

on	O

that	O
some	O

been	O
erroneously	O
charged	O
on	O

of	O

but	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
found	,
at	O
the	O

time	,
that	O
other	O
causes	O
will	O
not	O
alone	O
account	O
for	O
many	O
of	O
our	O

misfortunes	;
and	,
particularly	,
for	O
that	O
prevailing	O
and	O
increasing	O
distrust	O
of	O
public	O
engagements	,
and	O
alarm	O
for	O
private	O
rights	,
which	O
are	O
echoed	O
from	O
one	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
continent	O
to	O
the	O

these	O
must	O
be	O
chiefly	,
if	O
not	O
wholly	,
effects	O
of	O
the	O
unsteadiness	O
and	O
injustice	O
with	O

a	O

<bos>	O
by	O
a	O
faction	,
i	O
understand	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
citizens	,
whether	O
amounting	O
to	O
a	O
majority	O
or	O
a	O
minority	O
of	O
the	O
whole	,
who	O
are	O
united	O
and	O
actuated	O
by	O
some	O
common	O
impulse	O
of	O
passion	,
or	O
of	O

adversed	O
to	O

of	O

to	O
the	O
permanent	O
and	O
aggregate	O

of	O

<bos>	O
there	O
are	O
two	O
methods	O
of	O
curing	O
the	O
mischiefs	O
of	O
faction	:
the	O
one	,
by	O
removing	O
its	O
causes	;
the	O
other	,
by	O
controlling	O
its	O
effects	.

<bos>	O
there	O
are	O
again	O
two	O
methods	O
of	O
removing	O
the	O
causes	O
of	O
faction	:
the	O
one	,
by	O
destroying	O
the	O
liberty	O
which	O
is	O
essential	O
to	O
its	O
existence	;
the	O
other	,
by	O
giving	O
to	O
every	O
citizen	O
the	O
same	O
opinions	,
the	O
same	O
passions	,
and	O
the	O
same	O
interests	.

<bos>	O
it	O
could	O
never	O
be	O
more	O
truly	O
said	O
than	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
remedy	,
that	O
it	O
was	O
worse	O
than	O
the	O
disease	.
liberty	O
is	O
to	O
faction	O
what	O
air	O
is	O
to	O
fire	,
an	O
aliment	O
without	O
which	O
it	O
instantly	O
expires	.
but	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
less	O
folly	O
to	O
abolish	O
liberty	,
which	O
is	O
essential	O
to	O
political	O
life	,
because	O
it	O
nourishes	O
faction	,
than	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
to	O
wish	O
the	O
annihilation	O
of	O
air	,
which	O
is	O
essential	O
to	O
animal	O
life	,
because	O
it	O
imparts	O
to	O
fire	O
its	O
destructive	O
agency	.

the	O

be	O

the	O
apportionment	O
of	O

on	O
the	O

descriptions	O
of	O

is	O
an	O
act	O
which	O
seems	O
to	O
require	O
the	O
most	O

impartiality	;
yet	O
there	O
is	,
perhaps	,
no	O
legislative	O
act	O
in	O

opportunity	O
and	O

are	O
given	O

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O
in	O
vain	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
enlightened	O
statesmen	O
will	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
adjust	O
these	O

and	O
render	O
them	O
all	O
subservient	O
to	O
the	O
public	O

enlightened	O
statesmen	O
will	O
not	O
always	O
be	O
at	O
the	O
helm	.
nor	,
in	O
many	O
cases	,
can	O
such	O
an	O
adjustment	O
be	O
made	O
at	O
all	O
without	O
taking	O
into	O
view	O
indirect	O
and	O
remote	O
considerations	,
which	O
will	O
rarely	O
prevail	O
over	O
the	O
immediate	O
interest	O
which	O
one	O
party	O
may	O
find	O
in	O
disregarding	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
another	O
or	O
the	O
good	O
of	O
the	O
whole	.

<bos>	O
the	O
inference	O
to	O
which	O
we	O
are	O
brought	O
is	,
that	O
the	O
causes	O
of	O
faction	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
removed	,
and	O
that	O
relief	O
is	O
only	O
to	O
be	O
sought	O
in	O
the	O
means	O
of	O
controlling	O
its	O
effects	.

<bos>	O
if	O
a	O
faction	O
consists	O
of	O
less	O
than	O
a	O
majority	,
relief	O
is	O
supplied	O
by	O
the	O
republican	O
principle	,
which	O
enables	O
the	O
majority	O
to	O
defeat	O
its	O
sinister	O
views	O
by	O
regular	O
vote	.
it	O
may	O
clog	O
the	O
administration	,
it	O
may	O
convulse	O
the	O
society	;
but	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
unable	O
to	O
execute	O
and	O
mask	O
its	O
violence	O
under	O
the	O
forms	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	.
when	O
a	O
majority	O
is	O
included	O
in	O
a	O
faction	,
the	O
form	O
of	O
popular	O
government	,
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	,
enables	O
it	O
to	O
sacrifice	O
to	O
its	O
ruling	O
passion	O
or	O

both	O
the	O
public	O

to	O
preserve	O
the	O
spirit	O
and	O
the	O
form	O
of	O

is	O
then	O
the	O
great	O
object	O
to	O
which	O
our	O
inquiries	O
are	O
directed	.
let	O
me	O
add	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
great	O
desideratum	O
by	O
which	O
this	O
form	O
of	O
government	O
can	O
be	O
rescued	O
from	O
the	O
opprobrium	O
under	O
which	O
it	O
has	O
so	O
long	O
labored	,
and	O
be	O
recommended	O
to	O
the	O
esteem	O
and	O
adoption	O
of	O
mankind	.

<bos>	O
by	O
what	O
means	O
is	O
this	O
object	O
attainable	?
evidently	O
by	O
one	O
of	O
two	O
only	.
either	O
the	O
existence	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
passion	O
or	O
interest	O
in	O
a	O
majority	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
must	O
be	O
prevented	,
or	O
the	O
majority	,
having	O
such	O
coexistent	O
passion	O
or	O
interest	,
must	O
be	O
rendered	,
by	O
their	O
number	O
and	O
local	O
situation	,
unable	O
to	O
concert	O
and	O
carry	O
into	O
effect	O
schemes	O
of	O
oppression	.
if	O
the	O
impulse	O
and	O
the	O
opportunity	O
be	O
suffered	O
to	O
coincide	,
we	O
well	O
know	O
that	O
neither	O
moral	O
nor	O
religious	O
motives	O
can	O
be	O
relied	O
on	O
as	O
an	O
adequate	O
control	.
they	O
are	O
not	O
found	O
to	O
be	O
such	O
on	O
the	O
injustice	O
and	O
violence	O
of	O
individuals	,
and	O
lose	O
their	O
efficacy	O
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
the	O
number	O
combined	O
together	,
that	O
is	,
in	O
proportion	O
as	O
their	O
efficacy	O
becomes	O
needful	.

<bos>	O
from	O
this	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
subject	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
concluded	O
that	O
a	O
pure	O
democracy	,
by	O
which	O
i	O
mean	O
a	O
society	O
consisting	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
number	O
of	O
citizens	,
who	O
assemble	O
and	O
administer	O
the	O
government	O
in	O
person	,
can	O
admit	O
of	O
no	O
cure	O
for	O
the	O
mischiefs	O
of	O
faction	.
a	O
common	O
passion	O
or	O
interest	O
will	,
in	O
almost	O
every	O
case	,
be	O
felt	O
by	O
a	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
whole	;
a	O
communication	O
and	O
concert	O
result	O
from	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
government	O
itself	;
and	O
there	O
is	O
nothing	O
to	O
check	O
the	O
inducements	O
to	O
sacrifice	O
the	O
weaker	O
party	O
or	O
an	O
obnoxious	O
individual	.
hence	O
it	O
is	O
that	O
such	O
democracies	O
have	O
ever	O
been	O
spectacles	O
of	O
turbulence	O
and	O
contention	;
have	O
ever	O
been	O
found	O
incompatible	O
with	O
personal	O
security	O
or	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
property	;
and	O
have	O
in	O
general	O
been	O
as	O
short	O
in	O
their	O
lives	O
as	O
they	O
have	O
been	O
violent	O
in	O
their	O
deaths	.
theoretic	O
politicians	,
who	O
have	O
patronized	O
this	O
species	O
of	O
government	,
have	O
erroneously	O
supposed	O
that	O
by	O
reducing	O
mankind	O
to	O
a	O
perfect	O
equality	O
in	O
their	O
political	O
rights	,
they	O
would	,
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	,
be	O
perfectly	O
equalized	O
and	O
assimilated	O
in	O
their	O
possessions	,
their	O
opinions	,
and	O
their	O
passions	.

<bos>	O
a	O
republic	,
by	O
which	O
i	O
mean	O
a	O
government	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
scheme	O
of	O
representation	O
takes	O
place	,
opens	O
a	O
different	O
prospect	,
and	O
promises	O
the	O
cure	O
for	O
which	O
we	O
are	O
seeking	.
let	O
us	O
examine	O
the	O
points	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
varies	O
from	O
pure	O
democracy	,
and	O
we	O
shall	O
comprehend	O
both	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
cure	O
and	O
the	O
efficacy	O
which	O
it	O
must	O
derive	O
from	O
the	O
union	.

<bos>	O
the	O
two	O
great	O
points	O
of	O
difference	O
between	O
a	O
democracy	O
and	O
a	O
republic	O
are	:
first	,
the	O
delegation	O
of	O
the	O
government	,
in	O
the	O
latter	,
to	O
a	O
small	O
number	O
of	O
citizens	O
elected	O
by	O
the	O
rest	;
secondly	,
the	O
greater	O
number	O
of	O
citizens	,
and	O
greater	O
sphere	O
of	O
country	,
over	O
which	O
the	O
latter	O
may	O
be	O
extended	.

<bos>	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
difference	O
is	,
on	O
the	O
one	O
hand	,
to	O
refine	O
and	O
enlarge	O
the	O
public	O
views	,
by	O
passing	O
them	O
through	O
the	O
medium	O
of	O
a	O
chosen	O
body	O
of	O
citizens	,
whose	O
wisdom	O
may	O
best	O
discern	O
the	O
true	O
interest	O
of	O
their	O
country	,
and	O
whose	O
patriotism	O
and	O
love	O
of	O
justice	O
will	O
be	O
least	O
likely	O
to	O
sacrifice	O
it	O
to	O
temporary	O
or	O
partial	O
considerations	.
under	O
such	O
a	O
regulation	,
it	O
may	O
well	O
happen	O
that	O
the	O
public	O
voice	,
pronounced	O
by	O
the	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
will	O
be	O
more	O
consonant	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
good	O
than	O
if	O
pronounced	O
by	O
the	O
people	O
themselves	,
convened	O
for	O
the	O
purpose	.
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	,
the	O
effect	O
may	O
be	O
inverted	.
men	O
of	O
factious	O
tempers	,
of	O
local	O
prejudices	,
or	O
of	O
sinister	O
designs	,
may	,
by	O
intrigue	,
by	O
corruption	,
or	O
by	O
other	O
means	,
first	O
obtain	O
the	O
suffrages	,
and	O
then	O
betray	O
the	O
interests	,
of	O
the	O
people	.
the	O
question	O
resulting	O
is	,
whether	O
small	O
or	O
extensive	O
republics	O
are	O
more	O
favorable	O
to	O
the	O
election	O
of	O
proper	O
guardians	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
weal	;
and	O
it	O
is	O
clearly	O
decided	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
the	O
latter	O
by	O
two	O
obvious	O
considerations	:

<bos>	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	,
it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
remarked	O
that	,
however	O
small	O
the	O
republic	O
may	O
be	,
the	O
representatives	O
must	O
be	O
raised	O
to	O
a	O
certain	O
number	,
in	O
order	O
to	O
guard	O
against	O
the	O
cabals	O
of	O
a	O
few	;
and	O
that	,
however	O
large	O
it	O
may	O
be	,
they	O
must	O
be	O
limited	O
to	O
a	O
certain	O
number	,
in	O
order	O
to	O
guard	O
against	O
the	O
confusion	O
of	O
a	O
multitude	.
hence	,
the	O
number	O
of	O
representatives	O
in	O
the	O
two	O
cases	O
not	O
being	O
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
constituents	,
and	O
being	O
proportionally	O
greater	O
in	O
the	O
small	O
republic	,
it	O
follows	O
that	,
if	O
the	O
proportion	O
of	O
fit	O
characters	O
be	O
not	O
less	O
in	O
the	O
large	O
than	O
in	O
the	O
small	O
republic	,
the	O
former	O
will	O
present	O
a	O
greater	O
option	,
and	O
consequently	O
a	O
greater	O
probability	O
of	O
a	O
fit	O
choice	.

<bos>	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
place	,
as	O
each	O
representative	O
will	O
be	O
chosen	O
by	O
a	O
greater	O
number	O
of	O
citizens	O
in	O
the	O
large	O
than	O
in	O
the	O
small	O
republic	,
it	O
will	O
be	O
more	O
difficult	O
for	O
unworthy	O
candidates	O
to	O
practice	O
with	O
success	O
the	O
vicious	O
arts	O
by	O
which	O
elections	O
are	O
too	O
often	O
carried	;
and	O
the	O
suffrages	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
being	O
more	O
free	,
will	O
be	O
more	O
likely	O
to	O
centre	O
in	O
men	O
who	O
possess	O
the	O
most	O
attractive	O
merit	O
and	O
the	O
most	O
diffusive	O
and	O
established	O
characters	.

<bos>	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
confessed	O
that	O
in	O
this	,
as	O
in	O
most	O
other	O
cases	,
there	O
is	O
a	O
mean	,
on	O
both	O
sides	O
of	O
which	O
inconveniences	O
will	O
be	O
found	O
to	O
lie	.
by	O
enlarging	O
too	O
much	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
electors	,
you	O
render	O
the	O
representatives	O
too	O
little	O
acquainted	O
with	O
all	O
their	O
local	O
circumstances	O
and	O
lesser	O
interests	;
as	O
by	O
reducing	O
it	O
too	O
much	,
you	O
render	O
him	O
unduly	O
attached	O
to	O
these	,
and	O
too	O
little	O
fit	O
to	O
comprehend	O
and	O
pursue	O
great	O
and	O
national	O
objects	.
the	O
federal	O
constitution	O
forms	O
a	O
happy	O
combination	O
in	O
this	O
respect	;
the	O
great	O
and	O
aggregate	O
interests	O
being	O
referred	O
to	O
the	O
national	,
the	O
local	O
and	O
particular	O
to	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	.

<bos>	O
the	O
other	O
point	O
of	O
difference	O
is	,
the	O
greater	O
number	O
of	O
citizens	O
and	O
extent	O
of	O
territory	O
which	O
may	O
be	O
brought	O
within	O
the	O
compass	O
of	O
republican	O
than	O
of	O
democratic	O
government	;
and	O
it	O
is	O
this	O
circumstance	O
principally	O
which	O
renders	O
factious	O
combinations	O
less	O
to	O
be	O
dreaded	O
in	O
the	O
former	O
than	O
in	O
the	O
latter	.
the	O
smaller	O
the	O
society	,
the	O
fewer	O
probably	O
will	O
be	O
the	O
distinct	O
parties	O
and	O

composing	O
it	;
the	O
fewer	O
the	O
distinct	O
parties	O
and	O
interests	,
the	O
more	O
frequently	O
will	O
a	O
majority	O
be	O
found	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
party	;
and	O
the	O
smaller	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
individuals	O
composing	O
a	O
majority	,
and	O
the	O
smaller	O
the	O
compass	O
within	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
placed	,
the	O
more	O
easily	O
will	O
they	O
concert	O
and	O
execute	O
their	O
plans	O
of	O
oppression	.
extend	O
the	O
sphere	,
and	O
you	O
take	O
in	O
a	O
greater	O
variety	O
of	O
parties	O
and	O
interests	;
you	O
make	O
it	O
less	O
probable	O
that	O
a	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
will	O
have	O
a	O
common	O
motive	O
to	O
invade	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
other	O
citizens	;
or	O
if	O
such	O
a	O
common	O
motive	O
exists	,
it	O
will	O
be	O
more	O
difficult	O
for	O
all	O
who	O
feel	O
it	O
to	O
discover	O
their	O
own	O
strength	,
and	O
to	O
act	O
in	O
unison	O
with	O
each	O
other	.
besides	O
other	O
impediments	,
it	O
may	O
be	O
remarked	O
that	,
where	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
consciousness	O
of	O
unjust	O
or	O
dishonorable	O
purposes	,
communication	O
is	O
always	O
checked	O
by	O
distrust	O
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
the	O
number	O
whose	O
concurrence	O
is	O
necessary	.

<bos>	O
hence	,
it	O
clearly	O
appears	,
that	O
the	O
same	O
advantage	O
which	O
a	O
republic	O
has	O
over	O
a	O
democracy	,
in	O
controlling	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
faction	,
is	O
enjoyed	O
by	O
a	O

republic	,
--	O
is	O
enjoyed	O
by	O
the	O
union	O
over	O
the	O
states	O
composing	O
it	.
does	O
the	O
advantage	O
consist	O
in	O
the	O
substitution	O
of	O
representatives	O
whose	O
enlightened	O
views	O
and	O
virtuous	O
sentiments	O
render	O
them	O
superior	O
to	O
local	O
prejudices	O
and	O
schemes	O
of	O
injustice	?
it	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
denied	O
that	O
the	O
representation	O
of	O
the	O
union	O
will	O
be	O
most	O
likely	O
to	O
possess	O
these	O
requisite	O
endowments	.
does	O
it	O
consist	O
in	O
the	O
greater	O
security	O
afforded	O
by	O
a	O
greater	O
variety	O
of	O
parties	,
against	O
the	O
event	O
of	O
any	O
one	O
party	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
outnumber	O

degree	O
does	O
the	O
increased	O

of	O
parties	O
comprised	O
within	O
the	O

increase	O
this	O

does	O
it	,
in	O

consist	O
in	O

here	,

the	O
extent	O
of	O
the	O

it	O
the	O
most	O

advantage	.

<bos>	O
the	O
influence	O
of	O
factious	O
leaders	O
may	O
kindle	O
a	O
flame	O
within	O
their	O
particular	O

but	O
will	O
be	O
unable	O
to	O
spread	O
a	O
general	O
conflagration	O
through	O
the	O
other	O
states	.
a	O

sect	O
may	O
degenerate	O
into	O
a	O
political	O
faction	O
in	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
confederacy	;
but	O
the	O
variety	O
of	O

dispersed	O
over	O
the	O

of	O
it	O
must	O
secure	O
the	O
national	O

against	O
any	O
danger	O
from	O
that	O

for	O
any	O

be	O
less	O

to	O
pervade	O
the	O
whole	O

of	O
the	O

than	O
a	O
particular	O
member	O
of	O
it	;
in	O
the	O
same	O
proportion	O
as	O
such	O
a	O
malady	O
is	O
more	O
likely	O
to	O
taint	O
a	O

<bos>	O
in	O
the	O
extent	O
and	O
proper	O
structure	O
of	O
the	O

therefore	,
we	O
behold	O
a	O
republican	O
remedy	O
for	O
the	O
diseases	O
most	O
incident	O
to	O
republican	O
government	.
and	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
pleasure	O
and	O
pride	O
we	O
feel	O
in	O
being	O

our	O

<bos>	O
we	O
have	O
seen	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
the	O
union	,
as	O
our	O
bulwark	O
against	O
foreign	O
danger	,
as	O
the	O
conservator	O
of	O
peace	O
among	O
ourselves	,
as	O
the	O
guardian	O
of	O
our	O
commerce	O

other	O
common	O

as	O
the	O
only	O
substitute	O
for	O
those	O
military	O
establishments	O
which	O
have	O
subverted	O
the	O
liberties	O
of	O
the	O
old	O
world	,
and	O
as	O
the	O
proper	O
antidote	O
for	O
the	O
diseases	O
of	O
faction	,
which	O
have	O
proved	O
fatal	O
to	O
other	O
popular	O
governments	,
and	O
of	O
which	O
alarming	O
symptoms	O
have	O
been	O
betrayed	O
by	O
our	O

all	O
that	O
remains	,
within	O
this	O
branch	O
of	O
our	O
inquiries	,
is	O
to	O
take	O
notice	O
of	O
an	O
objection	O
that	O
may	O
be	O
drawn	O
from	O
the	O
great	O
extent	O
of	O
country	O
which	O
the	O
union	O
embraces	.
a	O
few	O
observations	O
on	O
this	O
subject	O
will	O
be	O
the	O
more	O
proper	,
as	O
it	O
is	O
perceived	O
that	O
the	O
adversaries	O
of	O
the	O
new	O
constitution	O
are	O
availing	O
themselves	O
of	O
the	O
prevailing	O
prejudice	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
practicable	O
sphere	O
of	O
republican	O
administration	,
in	O
order	O
to	O
supply	,
by	O
imaginary	O
difficulties	,
the	O
want	O
of	O
those	O
solid	O
objections	O
which	O
they	O
endeavor	O
in	O
vain	O
to	O
find	.

<bos>	O
the	O
error	O
which	O
limits	O
republican	O
government	O
to	O
a	O
narrow	O
district	O
has	O
been	O
unfolded	O
and	O
refuted	O
in	O
preceding	O
papers	.
i	O
remark	O
here	O
only	O
that	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
owe	O
its	O
rise	O
and	O
prevalence	O
chiefly	O
to	O
the	O
confounding	O
of	O
a	O
republic	O
with	O
a	O
democracy	,
applying	O
to	O
the	O
former	O
reasonings	O
drawn	O
from	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
latter	.
the	O
true	O
distinction	O
between	O
these	O
forms	O
was	O
also	O
adverted	O
to	O
on	O
a	O
former	O
occasion	.
it	O
is	,
that	O
in	O
a	O
democracy	,
the	O
people	O
meet	O
and	O
exercise	O
the	O
government	O
in	O
person	;
in	O
a	O
republic	,
they	O
assemble	O
and	O
administer	O
it	O
by	O
their	O
representatives	O
and	O
agents	.
a	O
democracy	,
consequently	,
will	O
be	O
confined	O
to	O
a	O
small	O
spot	.
a	O
republic	O
may	O
be	O
extended	O
over	O
a	O
large	O
region	.

<bos>	O
to	O
this	O
accidental	O
source	O
of	O
the	O
error	O
may	O
be	O
added	O
the	O
artifice	O
of	O
some	O
celebrated	O
authors	,
whose	O
writings	O
have	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
share	O
in	O
forming	O
the	O
modern	O
standard	O
of	O
political	O
opinions	.
being	O
subjects	O
either	O
of	O
an	O
absolute	O
or	O
limited	O
monarchy	,
they	O
have	O
endeavored	O
to	O
heighten	O
the	O
advantages	,
or	O
palliate	O
the	O
evils	O
of	O
those	O
forms	,
by	O
placing	O
in	O
comparison	O
the	O
vices	O
and	O
defects	O
of	O
the	O
republican	,
and	O
by	O
citing	O
as	O
specimens	O
of	O
the	O
latter	O
the	O
turbulent	O
democracies	O
of	O
ancient	O
greece	O
and	O
modern	O
italy	.
under	O
the	O
confusion	O
of	O
names	,
it	O
has	O
been	O
an	O
easy	O
task	O
to	O
transfer	O
to	O
a	O
republic	O
observations	O
applicable	O
to	O
a	O
democracy	O
only	;
and	O
among	O
others	,
the	O
observation	O
that	O
it	O
can	O
never	O
be	O
established	O
but	O
among	O
a	O
small	O
number	O
of	O
people	,
living	O
within	O
a	O
small	O
compass	O
of	O
territory	.

<bos>	O
such	O
a	O
fallacy	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
less	O
perceived	,
as	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
popular	O
governments	O
of	O
antiquity	O
were	O
of	O
the	O
democratic	O
species	;
and	O
even	O
in	O
modern	O
europe	,
to	O
which	O
we	O
owe	O
the	O
great	O
principle	O
of	O
representation	,
no	O
example	O
is	O
seen	O
of	O
a	O
government	O
wholly	O
popular	,
and	O
founded	,
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	,
wholly	O
on	O
that	O
principle	.
if	O
europe	O
has	O
the	O
merit	O
of	O
discovering	O
this	O
great	O
mechanical	O
power	O
in	O
government	,
by	O
the	O
simple	O
agency	O
of	O
which	O
the	O
will	O
of	O
the	O
largest	O
political	O
body	O
may	O
be	O
concentred	,
and	O
its	O
force	O
directed	O
to	O
any	O
object	O
which	O
the	O
public	O
good	O
requires	,
america	O
can	O
claim	O
the	O
merit	O
of	O
making	O
the	O
discovery	O
the	O
basis	O
of	O
unmixed	O
and	O
extensive	O
republics	.
it	O
is	O
only	O
to	O
be	O
lamented	O
that	O
any	O
of	O
her	O
citizens	O
should	O
wish	O
to	O
deprive	O
her	O
of	O
the	O
additional	O
merit	O
of	O
displaying	O
its	O
full	O
efficacy	O
in	O
the	O
establishment	O
of	O
the	O
comprehensive	O
system	O
now	O
under	O
her	O
consideration	.

<bos>	O
as	O
the	O
natural	O
limit	O
of	O
a	O
democracy	O
is	O
that	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
central	O
point	O
which	O
will	O
just	O
permit	O
the	O
most	O
remote	O
citizens	O
to	O
assemble	O
as	O
often	O
as	O
their	O
public	O
functions	O
demand	,
and	O
will	O
include	O
no	O
greater	O
number	O
than	O
can	O
join	O
in	O
those	O
functions	;
so	O
the	O
natural	O
limit	O
of	O
a	O
republic	O
is	O
that	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
centre	O
which	O
will	O
barely	O
allow	O
the	O
representatives	O
to	O
meet	O
as	O
often	O
as	O
may	O
be	O
necessary	O
for	O
the	O
administration	O
of	O
public	O
affairs	.
can	O
it	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
limits	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
exceed	O
this	O
distance	?
it	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
said	O
by	O
those	O
who	O
recollect	O
that	O
the	O
atlantic	O
coast	O
is	O
the	O
longest	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
union	,
that	O
during	O
the	O
term	O
of	O
thirteen	O
years	,
the	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
states	O
have	O
been	O
almost	O
continually	O
assembled	,
and	O
that	O
the	O
members	O
from	O
the	O
most	O
distant	O
states	O
are	O
not	O
chargeable	O
with	O
greater	O
intermissions	O
of	O
attendance	O
than	O
those	O
from	O
the	O
states	O
in	O
the	O
neighborhood	O
of	O
congress	.

<bos>	O
that	O
we	O
may	O
form	O
a	O
juster	O
estimate	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
this	O
interesting	O
subject	,
let	O
us	O
resort	O
to	O
the	O
actual	O
dimensions	O
of	O
the	O
union	.
the	O
limits	,
as	O
fixed	O
by	O
the	O
treaty	O
of	O
peace	,
are	:
on	O
the	O
east	O
the	O
atlantic	,
on	O
the	O
south	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
thirty-one	O
degrees	,
on	O
the	O
west	O
the	O
mississippi	,
and	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
an	O
irregular	O
line	O
running	O
in	O
some	O
instances	O
beyond	O
the	O
forty-fifth	O
degree	,
in	O
others	O
falling	O
as	O
low	O
as	O
the	O
forty-second	.
the	O
southern	O
shore	O
of	O
lake	O
erie	O
lies	O
below	O
that	O
latitude	.
computing	O
the	O
distance	O
between	O
the	O
thirty-first	O
and	O
forty-fifth	O
degrees	,
it	O
amounts	O
to	O
nine	O
hundred	O
and	O
seventy-three	O
common	O
miles	;
computing	O
it	O
from	O
thirty-one	O
to	O
forty-two	O
degrees	,
to	O
seven	O
hundred	O
and	O
sixty-four	O
miles	O
and	O
a	O
half	.
taking	O
the	O
mean	O
for	O
the	O
distance	,
the	O
amount	O
will	O
be	O
eight	O
hundred	O
and	O
sixty-eight	O
miles	O
and	O
three-fourths	.
the	O
mean	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
atlantic	O
to	O
the	O
mississippi	O
does	O
not	O
probably	O
exceed	O
seven	O
hundred	O
and	O
fifty	O
miles	.
on	O
a	O
comparison	O
of	O
this	O
extent	O
with	O
that	O
of	O
several	O
countries	O
in	O
europe	,
the	O
practicability	O
of	O
rendering	O
our	O
system	O
commensurate	O
to	O
it	O
appears	O
to	O
be	O
demonstrable	.
it	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
larger	O
than	O
germany	,
where	O
a	O
diet	O
representing	O
the	O
whole	O
empire	O
is	O
continually	O
assembled	;
or	O
than	O
poland	O
before	O
the	O
late	O
dismemberment	,
where	O
another	O
national	O
diet	O
was	O
the	O
depositary	O
of	O
the	O
supreme	O
power	.
passing	O
by	O
france	O
and	O
spain	,
we	O
find	O
that	O
in	O
great	O
britain	,
inferior	O
as	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
in	O
size	,
the	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
northern	O
extremity	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
have	O
as	O
far	O
to	O
travel	O
to	O
the	O
national	O
council	O
as	O
will	O
be	O
required	O
of	O
those	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
remote	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
union	.

<bos>	O
favorable	O
as	O
this	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
subject	O
may	O
be	,
some	O
observations	O
remain	O
which	O
will	O
place	O
it	O
in	O
a	O
light	O
still	O
more	O
satisfactory	.

<bos>	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
remembered	O
that	O
the	O
general	O
government	O
is	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
charged	O
with	O
the	O
whole	O
power	O
of	O
making	O
and	O
administering	O
laws	.
its	O
jurisdiction	O
is	O
limited	O
to	O
certain	O
enumerated	O
objects	,
which	O
concern	O
all	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
republic	,
but	O
which	O
are	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
attained	O
by	O
the	O
separate	O
provisions	O
of	O
any	.
the	O
subordinate	O
governments	,
which	O
can	O
extend	O
their	O
care	O
to	O
all	O
those	O
other	O
subjects	O
which	O
can	O
be	O
separately	O
provided	O
for	,
will	O
retain	O
their	O
due	O
authority	O
and	O
activity	.
were	O
it	O
proposed	O
by	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	O
to	O
abolish	O
the	O
governments	O
of	O
the	O
particular	O
states	,
its	O
adversaries	O
would	O
have	O
some	O
ground	O
for	O
their	O
objection	;
though	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
difficult	O
to	O
show	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
abolished	O
the	O
general	O
government	O
would	O
be	O
compelled	,
by	O
the	O
principle	O
of	O
self-preservation	,
to	O
reinstate	O
them	O
in	O
their	O
proper	O
jurisdiction	.

<bos>	O
a	O
second	O
observation	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
immediate	O
object	O
of	O
the	O
federal	O
constitution	O
is	O
to	O
secure	O
the	O
union	O
of	O
the	O
thirteen	O
primitive	O
states	,
which	O
we	O
know	O
to	O
be	O
practicable	;
and	O
to	O
add	O
to	O
them	O
such	O
other	O
states	O
as	O
may	O
arise	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
bosoms	,
or	O
in	O
their	O
neighborhoods	,
which	O
we	O
can	O
not	O
doubt	O
to	O
be	O
equally	O
practicable	.
the	O
arrangements	O
that	O
may	O
be	O
necessary	O
for	O
those	O
angles	O
and	O
fractions	O
of	O
our	O
territory	O
which	O
lie	O
on	O
our	O
northwestern	O
frontier	,
must	O
be	O
left	O
to	O
those	O
whom	O
further	O
discoveries	O
and	O
experience	O
will	O
render	O
more	O
equal	O
to	O
the	O
task	.

<bos>	O
let	O
it	O
be	O
remarked	,
in	O
the	O
third	O
place	,
that	O
the	O
intercourse	O
throughout	O
the	O
union	O
will	O
be	O
facilitated	O
by	O
new	O
improvements	.
roads	O
will	O
everywhere	O
be	O
shortened	,
and	O
kept	O
in	O
better	O
order	;
accommodations	O
for	O
travelers	O
will	O
be	O
multiplied	O
and	O
meliorated	;
an	O
interior	O
navigation	O
on	O
our	O
eastern	O
side	O
will	O
be	O
opened	O
throughout	,
or	O
nearly	O
throughout	,
the	O
whole	O
extent	O
of	O
the	O
thirteen	O
states	.
the	O
communication	O
between	O
the	O
western	O
and	O
atlantic	O
districts	,
and	O
between	O
different	O
parts	O
of	O
each	,
will	O
be	O
rendered	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
easy	O
by	O
those	O
numerous	O
canals	O
with	O
which	O
the	O
beneficence	O
of	O
nature	O
has	O
intersected	O
our	O
country	,
and	O
which	O
part	O
finds	O
it	O
so	O
little	O
difficult	O
to	O
connect	O
and	O
complete	.

<bos>	O
a	O
fourth	O
and	O
still	O
more	O
important	O
consideration	O
is	,
that	O
as	O
almost	O
every	O
state	O
will	,
on	O
one	O
side	O
or	O
other	,
be	O
a	O
frontier	,
and	O
will	O
thus	O
find	,
in	O
regard	O
to	O
its	O
safety	,
an	O
inducement	O
to	O
make	O
some	O
sacrifices	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
the	O
general	O
protection	;
so	O
the	O
states	O
which	O
lie	O
at	O
the	O
greatest	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
heart	O
of	O
the	O
union	,
and	O
which	,
of	O

the	O
objection	,
when	O
applied	O
to	O
real	O
property	O

to	O
houses	O

appears	O
to	O
have	,
at	O

even	O
in	O

of	O

this	O
that	O

performed	O
by	O

of	O

the	O
method	O
of	O
laying	O

collecting	O
this	O
species	O
of	O
taxes	O
in	O
each	O
state	O
can	,
in	O
all	O
its	O
parts	,
be	O
adopted	O
and	O
employed	O
by	O

federal	O
government	.

<bos>	O
let	O
it	O
be	O
recollected	O
that	O
the	O
proportion	O
of	O
these	O
taxes	O
is	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
left	O
to	O
the	O
discretion	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
legislature	,
but	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
determined	O
by	O
the	O
numbers	O
of	O
each	O
state	,
as	O
described	O
in	O
the	O
second	O
section	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
article	.
an	O
actual	O
census	O
or	O
enumeration	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
must	O
furnish	O
the	O
rule	,
a	O
circumstance	O
which	O
effectually	O
shuts	O
the	O
door	O
to	O
partiality	O
or	O
oppression	.
the	O
abuse	O
of	O
this	O
power	O
of	O
taxation	O
seems	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
provided	O
against	O
with	O
guarded	O
circumspection	.
in	O
addition	O
to	O
the	O
precaution	O
just	O
mentioned	,
there	O
is	O
a	O
provision	O
that	O
``	O
all	O
duties	,
imposts	,

excises	O
shall	O
be	O
uniform	O
throughout	O

<bos>	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
very	O
properly	O
observed	O
by	O
different	O
speakers	O
and	O
writers	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	,
that	O
if	O
the	O
exercise	O
of	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
internal	O
taxation	O
by	O
the	O
union	O
should	O
be	O
discovered	O
on	O
experiment	O
to	O
be	O
really	O
inconvenient	,
the	O
federal	O
government	O
may	O
then	O
forbear	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
it	,
and	O
have	O
recourse	O
to	O
requisitions	O
in	O
its	O
stead	.
by	O
way	O
of	O
answer	O
to	O
this	,
it	O
has	O
been	O
triumphantly	O
asked	,
why	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
instance	O
omit	O
that	O
ambiguous	O
power	,
and	O
rely	O
upon	O
the	O
latter	O
resource	?
two	O
solid	O
answers	O
may	O
be	O
given	.
the	O
first	O
is	,
that	O
the	O
exercise	O
of	O
that	O
power	,
if	O
convenient	,
will	O
be	O
preferable	,
because	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
more	O
effectual	;
and	O
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
prove	O
in	O
theory	,
or	O
otherwise	O
than	O
by	O
the	O
experiment	,
that	O
it	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
advantageously	O
exercised	.
the	O
contrary	,
indeed	,
appears	O
most	O
probable	.
the	O
second	O
answer	O
is	,
that	O
the	O
existence	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
power	O
in	O
the	O
constitution	O
will	O
have	O
a	O
strong	O
influence	O
in	O
giving	O
efficacy	O
to	O
requisitions	.
when	O
the	O
states	O
know	O
that	O
the	O
union	O
can	O
apply	O
itself	O
without	O
their	O
agency	,
it	O
will	O
be	O
a	O
powerful	O
motive	O
for	O
exertion	O
on	O
their	O
part	.

<bos>	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
interference	O
of	O
the	O
revenue	O
laws	O
of	O
the	O
union	,
and	O
of	O
its	O
members	,
we	O
have	O
already	O
seen	O
that	O
there	O
can	O
be	O
no	O
clashing	O
or	O
repugnancy	O
of	O
authority	.
the	O
laws	O
can	O
not	,
therefore	,
in	O
a	O
legal	O
sense	,
interfere	O
with	O
each	O
other	;
and	O
it	O
is	O
far	O
from	O
impossible	O
to	O
avoid	O
an	O
interference	O
even	O
in	O
the	O
policy	O
of	O
their	O
different	O
systems	.
an	O
effectual	O
expedient	O
for	O
this	O
purpose	O
will	O
be	,
mutually	,
to	O
abstain	O
from	O
those	O
objects	O
which	O
either	O
side	O
may	O
have	O
first	O
had	O
recourse	O
to	.
as	O
neither	O
can	O
control	O
the	O
other	,
each	O
will	O
have	O
an	O
obvious	O
and	O
sensible	O
interest	O
in	O
this	O
reciprocal	O
forbearance	.
and	O
where	O
there	O
is	O
an	O
immediate	O
common	O
interest	,
we	O
may	O
safely	O
count	O
upon	O
its	O
operation	.
when	O
the	O
particular	O
debts	O
of	O
the	O
states	O
are	O
done	O
away	,
and	O
their	O
expenses	O
come	O
to	O
be	O
limited	O
within	O
their	O
natural	O
compass	,
the	O
possibility	O
almost	O
of	O
interference	O
will	O
vanish	.
a	O
small	O
land	O
tax	O
will	O
answer	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
the	O
states	,
and	O
will	O
be	O
their	O
most	O
simple	O
and	O
most	O
fit	O
resource	.

<bos>	O
many	O
spectres	O
have	O
been	O
raised	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
power	O
of	O
internal	O
taxation	,
to	O
excite	O
the	O
apprehensions	O
of	O
the	O
people	:
double	O
sets	O
of	O
revenue	O
officers	,
a	O
duplication	O
of	O
their	O
burdens	O
by	O
double	O
taxations	,
and	O
the	O
frightful	O
forms	O
of	O
odious	O
and	O
oppressive	O
poll-taxes	,
have	O
been	O
played	O
off	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
ingenious	O
dexterity	O
of	O
political	O
legerdemain	.

<bos>	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
first	O
point	,
there	O
are	O
two	O
cases	O
in	O
which	O
there	O
can	O
be	O
no	O
room	O
for	O
double	O
sets	O
of	O
officers	:
one	,
where	O
the	O
right	O
of	O
imposing	O
the	O
tax	O
is	O
exclusively	O
vested	O
in	O
the	O
union	,
which	O
applies	O
to	O
the	O
duties	O
on	O
imports	;
the	O
other	,
where	O
the	O
object	O
has	O
not	O
fallen	O
under	O
any	O
state	O
regulation	O
or	O
provision	,
which	O
may	O
be	O
applicable	O
to	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
objects	.
in	O
other	O
cases	,
the	O
probability	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
will	O
either	O
wholly	O
abstain	O
from	O
the	O
objects	O
preoccupied	O
for	O
local	O
purposes	,
or	O
will	O
make	O
use	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
officers	O
and	O
state	O
regulations	O
for	O
collecting	O
the	O
additional	O
imposition	.
this	O
will	O
best	O
answer	O
the	O
views	O
of	O
revenue	,
because	O
it	O
will	O
save	O
expense	O
in	O
the	O
collection	,
and	O
will	O
best	O
avoid	O
any	O
occasion	O
of	O
disgust	O
to	O
the	O
state	O
governments	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
people	.
at	O
all	O
events	,
here	O
is	O
a	O
practicable	O
expedient	O
for	O
avoiding	O
such	O
an	O
inconvenience	;
and	O
nothing	O
more	O
can	O
be	O
required	O
than	O
to	O
show	O
that	O
evils	O
predicted	O
to	O
not	O
necessarily	O
result	O
from	O
the	O
plan	.

<bos>	O
as	O
to	O
any	O
argument	O
derived	O
from	O
a	O
supposed	O
system	O
of	O
influence	,
it	O
is	O
a	O
sufficient	O
answer	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
it	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
presumed	;
but	O
the	O
supposition	O
is	O
susceptible	O
of	O
a	O
more	O
precise	O
answer	.
if	O
such	O
a	O
spirit	O
should	O
infest	O
the	O
councils	O
of	O
the	O
union	,
the	O
most	O
certain	O
road	O
to	O
the	O
accomplishment	O
of	O
its	O
aim	O
would	O
be	O
to	O
employ	O
the	O
state	O
officers	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	,
and	O
to	O
attach	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
union	O
by	O
an	O
accumulation	O
of	O
their	O
emoluments	.
this	O
would	O
serve	O
to	O
turn	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
state	O
influence	O
into	O
the	O
channels	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
government	,
instead	O
of	O
making	O
federal	O
influence	O
flow	O
in	O
an	O
opposite	O
and	O
adverse	O
current	.
but	O
all	O
suppositions	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
are	O
invidious	,
and	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
banished	O
from	O
the	O
consideration	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
question	O
before	O
the	O
people	.
they	O
can	O
answer	O
no	O
other	O
end	O
than	O
to	O
cast	O
a	O
mist	O
over	O
the	O
truth	.

<bos>	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
suggestion	O
of	O
double	O
taxation	,
the	O
answer	O
is	O
plain	.
the	O
wants	O
of	O
the	O
union	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
supplied	O
in	O
one	O
way	O
or	O
another	;
if	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
by	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
federal	O
government	,
it	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
by	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
government	.
the	O
quantity	O
of	O
taxes	O
to	O
be	O
paid	O
by	O
the	O
community	O
must	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
in	O
either	O
case	;
with	O
this	O
advantage	,
if	O
the	O
provision	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
by	O
the	O
union	O
that	O
the	O
capital	O
resource	O
of	O
commercial	O
imposts	,
which	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
convenient	O
branch	O
of	O
revenue	,
can	O
be	O
prudently	O
improved	O
to	O
a	O
much	O
greater	O
extent	O
under	O
federal	O
than	O
under	O
state	O
regulation	,
and	O
of	O
course	O
will	O
render	O
it	O
less	O
necessary	O
to	O
recur	O
to	O
more	O
inconvenient	O
methods	;
and	O
with	O
this	O
further	O
advantage	,
that	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
there	O
may	O
be	O
any	O
real	O
difficulty	O
in	O
the	O
exercise	O
of	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
internal	O
taxation	,
it	O
will	O
impose	O
a	O
disposition	O
to	O
greater	O
care	O
in	O
the	O
choice	O
and	O
arrangement	O
of	O
the	O
means	;
and	O
must	O
naturally	O
tend	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
a	O
fixed	O
point	O
of	O
policy	O
in	O
the	O
national	O
administration	O
to	O
go	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
may	O
be	O
practicable	O
in	O
making	O
the	O
luxury	O
of	O
the	O
rich	O
tributary	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
treasury	,
in	O
order	O
to	O
diminish	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
those	O
impositions	O
which	O
might	O
create	O
dissatisfaction	O
in	O
the	O
poorer	O
and	O
most	O
numerous	O
classes	O
of	O
the	O
society	.
happy	O
it	O
is	O
when	O
the	O
interest	O
which	O
the	O
government	O
has	O
in	O
the	O
preservation	O
of	O
its	O
own	O
power	,
coincides	O
with	O
a	O
proper	O
distribution	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
burdens	,
and	O
tends	O
to	O
guard	O
the	O
least	O
wealthy	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
community	O
from	O
oppression	!

<bos>	O
as	O
to	O
poll	O
taxes	,
i	,
without	O
scruple	,
confess	O
my	O
disapprobation	O
of	O
them	;
and	O
though	O
they	O
have	O
prevailed	O
from	O
an	O
early	O
period	O
in	O
those	O
states1	O
which	O
have	O
uniformly	O
been	O
the	O
most	O
tenacious	O
of	O
their	O
rights	,
i	O
should	O
lament	O
to	O
see	O
them	O
introduced	O
into	O
practice	O
under	O
the	O
national	O
government	.
but	O
does	O
it	O
follow	O
because	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
power	O
to	O
lay	O
them	O
that	O
they	O
will	O
actually	O
be	O
laid	?
every	O
state	O
in	O
the	O
union	O
has	O
power	O
to	O
impose	O
taxes	O
of	O
this	O
kind	;
and	O
yet	O
in	O
several	O
of	O
them	O
they	O
are	O
unknown	O
in	O
practice	.
are	O
the	O
state	O
governments	O
to	O
be	O
stigmatized	O
as	O
tyrannies	,
because	O
they	O
possess	O
this	O
power	?
if	O
they	O
are	O
not	,
with	O
what	O
propriety	O
can	O
the	O
like	O
power	O
justify	O
such	O
a	O
charge	O
against	O
the	O
national	O
government	,
or	O
even	O
be	O
urged	O
as	O
an	O
obstacle	O
to	O
its	O
adoption	?
as	O
little	O
friendly	O
as	O
i	O
am	O
to	O
the	O
species	O
of	O
imposition	,
i	O
still	O
feel	O
a	O
thorough	O
conviction	O
that	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
having	O
recourse	O
to	O
it	O
ought	O
to	O
exist	O
in	O
the	O
federal	O

there	O

it	O

that	O
``	O

it	O
is	O
not	O
easy	O
to	O
conceive	O
a	O
plan	O
better	O
calculated	O
than	O
this	O

that	O

modified	O
in	O
one	O

this	,
i	O
proceed	O
to	O
lay	O
it	O
down	O
as	O
a	O
rule	,
that	O
one	O
man	O
of	O
discernment	O
is	O
better	O
fitted	O
to	O
analyze	O
and	O
estimate	O
the	O
peculiar	O
qualities	O
adapted	O
to	O
particular	O
offices	,
than	O
a	O
body	O
of	O
men	O
of	O
equal	O
or	O
perhaps	O
even	O
of	O
superior	O
discernment	.

<bos>	O
the	O
sole	O
and	O
undivided	O
responsibility	O
of	O
one	O
man	O
will	O
naturally	O
beget	O
a	O
livelier	O
sense	O
of	O
duty	O
and	O
a	O
more	O
exact	O
regard	O
to	O
reputation	.
he	O
will	,
on	O
this	O
account	,
feel	O
himself	O
under	O
stronger	O
obligations	,
and	O
more	O
interested	O
to	O
investigate	O
with	O
care	O
the	O
qualities	O
requisite	O
to	O
the	O
stations	O
to	O
be	O
filled	,
and	O
to	O
prefer	O
with	O
impartiality	O
the	O
persons	O
who	O
may	O
have	O
the	O
fairest	O
pretensions	O
to	O
them	.
he	O
will	O
have	O
fewer	O
personal	O
attachments	O
to	O
gratify	,
than	O
a	O
body	O
of	O
men	O
who	O
may	O
each	O
be	O
supposed	O
to	O
have	O
an	O
equal	O
number	;
and	O
will	O
be	O
so	O
much	O
the	O
less	O
liable	O
to	O
be	O
misled	O
by	O
the	O
sentiments	O
of	O
friendship	O
and	O
of	O
affection	.
a	O
single	O
well-directed	O
man	,

a	O

not	O
be	O
distracted	O

warped	O
by	O
that	O
diversity	O
of	O

feel	O
to	O

a	O
kind	O
of	O

have	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
a	O
reflection	O
upon	O
the	O

to	O

a	O
powerful	,
though	,
in	O
general	,
a	O

operation	.
it	O
would	O
be	O
an	O
excellent	O
check	O
upon	O
a	O
spirit	O
of	O
favoritism	O
in	O
the	O

would	O
tend	O

<bos>	O
it	O
will	O
readily	O
be	O
comprehended	,
that	O
a	O
man	O
who	O

himself	O
the	O

of	O

would	O
be	O
governed	O
much	O
more	O
by	O
his	O
private	O
inclinations	O
and	O
interests	,
than	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
bound	O
to	O
submit	O
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
his	O
choice	O
to	O
the	O
discussion	O

a	O

would	O
be	O
both	O

to	O

to	O
this	O

that	O

this	O

it	O

no	O

too	O
malignant	,
not	O
to	O
excite	O
the	O
indignation	O
of	O
every	O
man	O
who	O
feels	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
bosom	O
a	O
refutation	O
of	O
the	O
calumny	.
the	O
perpetual	O
changes	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
rung	O
upon	O
the	O
wealthy	,
the	O
well-born	,
and	O
the	O
great	,
have	O
been	O
such	O
as	O
to	O
inspire	O
the	O
disgust	O
of	O
all	O
sensible	O
men	.
and	O
the	O
unwarrantable	O
concealments	O
and	O
misrepresentations	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
various	O
ways	O
practiced	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
truth	O
from	O
the	O
public	O
eye	,

of	O
a	O
nature	O
to	O
demand	O
the	O
reprobation	O
of	O
all	O
honest	O
men	.
it	O
is	O
not	O
impossible	O
that	O
these	O
circumstances	O
may	O
have	O
occasionally	O
betrayed	O
me	O
into	O
intemperances	O
of	O
expression	O
which	O
i	O
did	O
not	O
intend	;
it	O
is	O
certain	O
that	O
i	O
have	O
frequently	O
felt	O
a	O
struggle	O
between	O
sensibility	O
and	O
moderation	;
and	O
if	O
the	O
former	O
has	O
in	O
some	O
instances	O
prevailed	,
it	O
must	O
be	O
my	O
excuse	O
that	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
neither	O
often	O
nor	O
much	.

<bos>	O
let	O
us	O
now	O
pause	O
and	O
ask	O
ourselves	O
whether	,
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
these	O
papers	,
the	O
proposed	O
constitution	O
has	O
not	O
been	O
satisfactorily	O
vindicated	O
from	O
the	O
aspersions	O
thrown	O
upon	O
it	;
and	O
whether	O
it	O
has	O
not	O
been	O
shown	O
to	O
be	O
worthy	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
approbation	,
and	O
necessary	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
safety	O
and	O
prosperity	.
every	O
man	O
is	O
bound	O
to	O
answer	O
these	O
questions	O
to	O
himself	,
according	O
to	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
his	O
conscience	O
and	O
understanding	,
and	O
to	O
act	O
agreeably	O
to	O
the	O
genuine	O
and	O
sober	O
dictates	O
of	O
his	O
judgment	.
this	O
is	O
a	O
duty	O
from	O
which	O
nothing	O
can	O
give	O
him	O
a	O
dispensation	.
't	O
is	O
one	O
that	O
he	O
is	O
called	O
upon	,
nay	,
constrained	O
by	O
all	O
the	O
obligations	O
that	O

of	O

sincerely	O

to	O
himself	,

his	O

to	O
his	O
posterity	,
an	O
improper	O
election	O
of	O
the	O
part	O
he	O
is	O
to	O
act	.
let	O
him	O
beware	O
of	O
an	O
obstinate	O
adherence	O
to	O
party	;
let	O
him	O
reflect	O
that	O
the	O
object	O
upon	O
which	O
he	O
is	O
to	O
decide	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
particular	O
interest	O
of	O
the	O
community	,
but	O
the	O
very	O
existence	O
of	O
the	O
nation	;
and	O
let	O
him	O
remember	O
that	O
a	O
majority	O
of	O
america	O
has	O
already	O
given	O
its	O
sanction	O
to	O
the	O
plan	O
which	O
he	O
is	O
to	O
approve	O
or	O
reject	.

<bos>	O
i	O
shall	O
not	O
dissemble	O
that	O
i	O
feel	O
an	O
entire	O
confidence	O
in	O
the	O
arguments	O
which	O
recommend	O
the	O
proposed	O
system	O
to	O
your	O
adoption	,
and	O
that	O
i	O
am	O
unable	O
to	O
discern	O
any	O
real	O
force	O
in	O
those	O
by	O
which	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
opposed	.
i	O
am	O
persuaded	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
which	O
our	O
political	O
situation	,
habits	,
and	O
opinions	O
will	O
admit	,
and	O
superior	O
to	O
any	O
the	O
revolution	O
has	O
produced	.

<bos>	O
concessions	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
friends	O
of	O
the	O
plan	,
that	O
it	O
has	O
not	O
a	O
claim	O
to	O
absolute	O
perfection	,
have	O
afforded	O
matter	O
of	O
no	O
small	O
triumph	O
to	O
its	O
enemies	.
``	O
why	,

say	O
they	,
``	O
should	O

an	O

''	O
this	O
may	O

plausible	O
enough	,
but	O
it	O
is	O
only	O
plausible	.
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
i	O
remark	,
that	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
these	O
concessions	O
has	O
been	O
greatly	O
exaggerated	.
they	O
have	O
been	O
stated	O
as	O
amounting	O
to	O
an	O
admission	O
that	O
the	O
plan	O
is	O
radically	O
defective	,
and	O
that	O
without	O
material	O
alterations	O
the	O
rights	O
and	O
the	O
interests	O
of	O
the	O
community	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
safely	O

to	O
it	.
this	,
as	O
far	O
as	O
i	O
have	O
understood	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
make	O
the	O
concessions	,
is	O
an	O
entire	O
perversion	O
of	O
their	O
sense	.
no	O
advocate	O
of	O
the	O
measure	O
can	O
be	O
found	,
who	O
will	O
not	O
declare	O
as	O
his	O
sentiment	,
that	O
the	O
system	,
though	O
it	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
perfect	O
in	O
every	O
part	,
is	,
upon	O
the	O
whole	,
a	O
good	O
one	;
is	O
the	O
best	O
that	O
the	O
present	O
views	O
and	O
circumstances	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
will	O
permit	;
and	O
is	O
such	O
an	O
one	O
as	O
promises	O
every	O
species	O
of	O
security	O
which	O
a	O
reasonable	O
people	O
can	O
desire	.

<bos>	O
i	O
answer	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
place	,
that	O
i	O
should	O
esteem	O
it	O
the	O
extreme	O
of	O
imprudence	O
to	O
prolong	O
the	O
precarious	O
state	O
of	O
our	O
national	O
affairs	,
and	O
to	O
expose	O
the	O
union	O
to	O
the	O
jeopardy	O
of	O
successive	O
experiments	,
in	O
the	O
chimerical	O
pursuit	O
of	O
a	O
perfect	O
plan	.
i	O
never	O
expect	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
perfect	O
work	O
from	O
imperfect	O
man	.
the	O
result	O
of	O
the	O
deliberations	O
of	O
all	O
collective	O
bodies	O
must	O
necessarily	O
be	O
a	O
compound	,
as	O
well	O
of	O
the	O
errors	O
and	O
prejudices	,
as	O
of	O
the	O
good	O
sense	O
and	O
wisdom	,
of	O
the	O
individuals	O
of	O
whom	O
they	O
are	O
composed	.
the	O
compacts	O
which	O
are	O
to	O
embrace	O
thirteen	O
distinct	O
states	O
in	O
a	O
common	O
bond	O
of	O
amity	O
and	O
union	,
must	O
as	O
necessarily	O
be	O
a	O
compromise	O
of	O
as	O
many	O
dissimilar	O
interests	O
and	O
inclinations	.
how	O
can	O
perfection	O
spring	O
from	O
such	O
materials	?

<bos>	O
the	O
reasons	O
assigned	O
in	O
an	O
excellent	O
little	O
pamphlet	O
lately	O
published	O
in	O
this	O
city,1	O
are	O
unanswerable	O
to	O
show	O
the	O
utter	O
improbability	O
of	O
assembling	O
a	O
new	O
convention	,
under	O
circumstances	O
in	O
any	O
degree	O
so	O
favorable	O
to	O
a	O
happy	O
issue	,
as	O
those	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
late	O
convention	O
met	,
deliberated	,
and	O
concluded	.
i	O
will	O
not	O
repeat	O
the	O
arguments	O
there	O
used	,
as	O
i	O
presume	O
the	O
production	O
itself	O
has	O
had	O
an	O
extensive	O
circulation	.
it	O
is	O
certainly	O
well	O
worthy	O
the	O
perusal	O
of	O
every	O
friend	O
to	O
his	O
country	.
there	O
is	,
however	,
one	O
point	O
of	O
light	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
amendments	O
still	O
remains	O
to	O
be	O
considered	,
and	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
has	O
not	O
yet	O
been	O
exhibited	O
to	O
public	O
view	.
i	O
can	O
not	O
resolve	O
to	O
conclude	O
without	O
first	O
taking	O
a	O
survey	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
this	O
aspect	.

<bos>	O
it	O
appears	O
to	O
me	O
susceptible	O
of	O
absolute	O
demonstration	,
that	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
far	O
more	O
easy	O
to	O
obtain	O
subsequent	O
than	O
previous	O
amendments	O
to	O
the	O
constitution	.
the	O
moment	O
an	O
alteration	O
is	O
made	O
in	O
the	O
present	O
plan	,
it	O
becomes	,
to	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
adoption	,
a	O
new	O
one	,
and	O
must	O
undergo	O
a	O
new	O
decision	O
of	O
each	O
state	.
to	O
its	O
complete	O
establishment	O
throughout	O
the	O
union	,
it	O
will	O
therefore	O
require	O
the	O
concurrence	O
of	O
thirteen	O
states	.
if	,
on	O
the	O
contrary	,
the	O
constitution	O
proposed	O
should	O
once	O
be	O
ratified	O
by	O
all	O
the	O
states	O
as	O
it	O
stands	,
alterations	O
in	O
it	O
may	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
be	O
effected	O
by	O
nine	O
states	.
here	,
then	,
the	O
chances	O
are	O
as	O
thirteen	O
to	O
nine2	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
subsequent	O
amendment	,
rather	O
than	O
of	O
the	O
original	O
adoption	O
of	O
an	O
entire	O
system	.

<bos>	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
all	.
every	O
constitution	O
for	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
must	O
inevitably	O
consist	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
variety	O
of	O
particulars	,
in	O
which	O
thirteen	O
independent	O
states	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
accommodated	O
in	O
their	O
interests	O
or	O
opinions	O
of	O
interest	.
we	O
may	O
of	O
course	O
expect	O
to	O
see	,
in	O
any	O
body	O
of	O
men	O
charged	O
with	O
its	O
original	O
formation	,
very	O
different	O
combinations	O
of	O
the	O
parts	O
upon	O
different	O
points	.
many	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
form	O
a	O
majority	O
on	O
one	O
question	,
may	O
become	O
the	O
minority	O
on	O
a	O
second	,
and	O
an	O
association	O
dissimilar	O
to	O
either	O
may	O
constitute	O
the	O
majority	O
on	O
a	O
third	.
hence	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
moulding	O
and	O
arranging	O
all	O
the	O
particulars	O
which	O
are	O
to	O
compose	O
the	O
whole	,
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
as	O
to	O
satisfy	O
all	O
the	O
parties	O
to	O
the	O
compact	;
and	O
hence	,
also	,
an	O
immense	O
multiplication	O
of	O
difficulties	O
and	O
casualties	O
in	O
obtaining	O
the	O
collective	O
assent	O
to	O
a	O
final	O
act	.
the	O
degree	O
of	O
that	O
multiplication	O
must	O
evidently	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
ratio	O
to	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
particulars	O
and	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
parties	.

<bos>	O
but	O
every	O
amendment	O
to	O
the	O
constitution	,
if	O
once	O
established	,
would	O
be	O
a	O
single	O
proposition	,
and	O
might	O
be	O
brought	O
forward	O
singly	.
there	O
would	O
then	O
be	O
no	O
necessity	O
for	O
management	O
or	O
compromise	,
in	O
relation	O
to	O
any	O
other	O
point	O
no	O
giving	O
nor	O
taking	.
the	O
will	O
of	O
the	O
requisite	O
number	O
would	O
at	O
once	O
bring	O
the	O
matter	O
to	O
a	O
decisive	O
issue	.
and	O
consequently	,
whenever	O
nine	,
or	O
rather	O
ten	O
states	,
were	O
united	O
in	O
the	O
desire	O
of	O
a	O
particular	O
amendment	,
that	O
amendment	O
must	O
infallibly	O
take	O
place	.
there	O
can	,
therefore	,
be	O
no	O
comparison	O
between	O
the	O
facility	O
of	O
affecting	O
an	O
amendment	,
and	O
that	O
of	O
establishing	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
instance	O
a	O
complete	O
constitution	.

<bos>	O
in	O
opposition	O
to	O
the	O
probability	O
of	O
subsequent	O
amendments	,
it	O
has	O
been	O
urged	O
that	O
the	O
persons	O
delegated	O
to	O
the	O
administration	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
government	O
will	O
always	O
be	O

up	O
any	O
portion	O
of	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
once	O
possessed	.
for	O
my	O
own	O
part	O
i	O
acknowledge	O
a	O
thorough	O
conviction	O
that	O
any	O
amendments	O
which	O
may	,
upon	O
mature	O
consideration	,
be	O
thought	O
useful	,
will	O
be	O
applicable	O
to	O
the	O
organization	O
of	O
the	O

not	O
to	O
the	O
mass	O
of	O
its	O
powers	;

on	O
this	O

there	O
is	O
no	O

in	O
the	O

also	O

upon	O

a	O

<bos>	O
in	O
this	O
review	O
of	O
the	O
confederation	,
i	O
have	O
confined	O
myself	O
to	O
the	O
exhibition	O
of	O
its	O
most	O
material	O
defects	;
passing	O
over	O
those	O
imperfections	O
in	O
its	O
details	O
by	O
which	O
even	O
a	O
great	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
power	O
intended	O
to	O
be	O
conferred	O
upon	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
measure	O
rendered	O
abortive	.
it	O
must	O
be	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
evident	O
to	O
all	O
men	O
of	O
reflection	,
who	O
can	O
divest	O
themselves	O
of	O
the	O
prepossessions	O
of	O
preconceived	O
opinions	,
that	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
system	O
so	O
radically	O
vicious	O
and	O
unsound	,
as	O
to	O
admit	O
not	O
of	O
amendment	O
but	O
by	O
an	O
entire	O
change	O
in	O
its	O
leading	O
features	O
and	O
characters	.

<bos>	O
the	O
organization	O
of	O
congress	O
is	O
itself	O
utterly	O
improper	O
for	O
the	O
exercise	O
of	O
those	O
powers	O
which	O
are	O
necessary	O
to	O
be	O
deposited	O
in	O
the	O
union	.
a	O
single	O
assembly	O
may	O
be	O
a	O
proper	O
receptacle	O
of	O
those	O
slender	,
or	O
rather	O
fettered	,
authorities	,
which	O
have	O
been	O
heretofore	O
delegated	O
to	O
the	O
federal	O
head	;
but	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
inconsistent	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
principles	O
of	O
good	O
government	,
to	O
intrust	O
it	O
with	O
those	O
additional	O
powers	O
which	,
even	O
the	O
moderate	O
and	O
more	O
rational	O
adversaries	O
of	O
the	O
proposed	O
constitution	O
admit	,
ought	O
to	O
reside	O
in	O
the	O
united	O
states	.
if	O
that	O
plan	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
adopted	,
and	O
if	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
the	O
union	O
should	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
withstand	O
the	O
ambitious	O
aims	O
of	O
those	O
men	O
who	O
may	O
indulge	O
magnificent	O
schemes	O
of	O
personal	O
aggrandizement	O
from	O
its	O
dissolution	,
the	O
probability	O
would	O
be	,
that	O
we	O
should	O
run	O
into	O
the	O
project	O
of	O
conferring	O
supplementary	O
powers	O
upon	O
congress	,
as	O
they	O
are	O
now	O
constituted	;
and	O
either	O
the	O
machine	,
from	O
the	O
intrinsic	O
feebleness	O
of	O
its	O
structure	,
will	O
moulder	O
into	O
pieces	,
in	O
spite	O
of	O
our	O
ill-judged	O
efforts	O
to	O
prop	O
it	;
or	,
by	O
successive	O
augmentations	O
of	O
its	O
force	O
an	O
energy	,
as	O
necessity	O
might	O
prompt	,
we	O
shall	O
finally	O
accumulate	,
in	O
a	O
single	O
body	,
all	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
prerogatives	O
of	O
sovereignty	,
and	O
thus	O
entail	O
upon	O
our	O
posterity	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
execrable	O
forms	O
of	O
government	O
that	O
human	O
infatuation	O
ever	O
contrived	.
thus	,
we	O
should	O
create	O
in	O
reality	O
that	O
very	O
tyranny	O
which	O
the	O
adversaries	O
of	O
the	O
new	O
constitution	O
either	O
are	,
or	O
affect	O
to	O
be	,
solicitous	O
to	O
avert	.

<bos>	O
it	O
has	O
not	O
a	O
little	O
contributed	O
to	O
the	O
infirmities	O
of	O
the	O
existing	O
federal	O
system	,
that	O
it	O
never	O
had	O
a	O
ratification	O
by	O
the	O
people	.
resting	O
on	O
no	O
better	O
foundation	O
than	O
the	O
consent	O
of	O
the	O
several	O
legislatures	,
it	O
has	O
been	O
exposed	O
to	O
frequent	O
and	O
intricate	O
questions	O
concerning	O
the	O
validity	O
of	O
its	O
powers	,
and	O
has	,
in	O
some	O
instances	,
given	O
birth	O
to	O
the	O
enormous	O
doctrine	O
of	O
a	O
right	O
of	O
legislative	O
repeal	.
owing	O
its	O
ratification	O
to	O
the	O
law	O
of	O
a	O
state	,
it	O
has	O
been	O
contended	O
that	O
the	O
same	O
authority	O
might	O
repeal	O
the	O
law	O
by	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
ratified	.
however	O
gross	O
a	O
heresy	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
to	O
maintain	O
that	O
a	O
party	O
to	O
a	O
compact	O
has	O
a	O
right	O
to	O
revoke	O
that	O

respectable	O
advocates	.
the	O
possibility	O
of	O

this	O

the	O
necessity	O
of	O
laying	O
the	O
foundations	O
of	O
our	O
national	O
government	O
deeper	O
than	O
in	O
the	O
mere	O
sanction	O

the	O

in	O

a	O
summary	O
review	O
of	O
the	O

which	O
have	O
depicted	O
the	O
genius	O

confederate	O
governments	,
i	O
shall	O
now	O
proceed	O
in	O
the	O
enumeration	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
of	O
those	O
defects	O
which	O
have	O
hitherto	O
disappointed	O
our	O
hopes	O
from	O
the	O
system	O
established	O
among	O
ourselves	.
to	O
form	O
a	O
safe	O
and	O
satisfactory	O
judgment	O
of	O
the	O
proper	O
remedy	,
it	O
is	O
absolutely	O
necessary	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
well	O
acquainted	O
with	O
the	O
extent	O
and	O
malignity	O
of	O
the	O
disease	.

<bos>	O
the	O
next	O
most	O
palpable	O
defect	O
of	O
the	O
subsisting	O
confederation	,
is	O
the	O
total	O
want	O
of	O
a	O
sanction	O
to	O
its	O
laws	.
the	O
united	O
states	,
as	O
now	O
composed	,
have	O
no	O
powers	O
to	O
exact	O
obedience	,
or	O
punish	O
disobedience	O
to	O
their	O
resolutions	,
either	O
by	O
pecuniary	O
mulcts	,
by	O
a	O
suspension	O
or	O
divestiture	O
of	O
privileges	,
or	O
by	O
any	O
other	O
constitutional	O
mode	.
there	O
is	O
no	O
express	O
delegation	O
of	O
authority	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
use	O
force	O
against	O
delinquent	O
members	;
and	O
if	O
such	O
a	O
right	O
should	O
be	O
ascribed	O
to	O
the	O
federal	O
head	,
as	O
resulting	O
from	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
social	O
compact	O
between	O
the	O
states	,
it	O
must	O
be	O
by	O
inference	O
and	O
construction	,
in	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
second	O
article	,
by	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
declared	,
``	O
that	O
each	O
state	O
shall	O
retain	O
every	O
power	,
jurisdiction	,
and	O
right	,
not	O
expressly	O
delegated	O
to	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
in	O
congress	O
assembled	.
''	O
there	O
is	,
doubtless	,
a	O
striking	O
absurdity	O
in	O
supposing	O
that	O
a	O
right	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
does	O
not	O
exist	,
but	O
we	O
are	O
reduced	O
to	O
the	O
dilemma	O
either	O
of	O
embracing	O
that	O
supposition	,
preposterous	O
as	O
it	O
may	O
seem	,
or	O
of	O
contravening	O
or	O
explaining	O
away	O
a	O
provision	,
which	O
has	O
been	O
of	O
late	O
a	O
repeated	O
theme	O
of	O
the	O
eulogies	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
oppose	O
the	O
new	O
constitution	;
and	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
which	,
in	O
that	O
plan	,
has	O
been	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
much	O
plausible	O
animadversion	,
and	O
severe	O
criticism	.
if	O
we	O
are	O
unwilling	O
to	O
impair	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
this	O
applauded	O
provision	,
we	O
shall	O
be	O
obliged	O
to	O
conclude	,
that	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
afford	O
the	O
extraordinary	O
spectacle	O
of	O
a	O
government	O
destitute	O
even	O
of	O
the	O
shadow	O
of	O
constitutional	O
power	O
to	O
enforce	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
its	O
own	O
laws	.
it	O
will	O
appear	,
from	O
the	O
specimens	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
cited	,
that	O
the	O
american	O
confederacy	,
in	O
this	O
particular	,
stands	O
discriminated	O
from	O
every	O
other	O
institution	O
of	O
a	O
similar	O
kind	,
and	O
exhibits	O
a	O
new	O
and	O
unexampled	O
phenomenon	O
in	O
the	O
political	O
world	.

<bos>	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
a	O
mutual	O
guaranty	O
of	O
the	O

is	O
another	O
capital	O
imperfection	O
in	O
the	O
federal	O
plan	.
there	O
is	O
nothing	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
declared	O
in	O
the	O
articles	O
that	O
compose	O
it	;
and	O
to	O
imply	O
a	O
tacit	O
guaranty	O
from	O
considerations	O
of	O
utility	,
would	O
be	O
a	O
still	O
more	O
flagrant	O
departure	O
from	O
the	O
clause	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
mentioned	,
than	O
to	O
imply	O
a	O
tacit	O
power	O
of	O
coercion	O
from	O
the	O

considerations	.
the	O
want	O
of	O
a	O

it	O

its	O
consequences	O

the	O

<bos>	O
the	O

to	O

an	O
objection	O

the	O

no	O
man	O

will	O
doubt	O
that	O
the	O

of	O

bears	O
a	O
much	O
greater	O
proportion	O
to	O

than	O
it	O
would	O

<bos>	O
the	O

upon	O
an	O

situation	,

the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O

the	O

the	O

clearly	O
is	O
that	O
there	O
can	O

the	O

the	O

rule	,
can	O
not	O
fail	O
to	O
be	O
productive	O
of	O
glaring	O
inequality	O
and	O
extreme	O
oppression	.

<bos>	O
this	O
inequality	O
would	O
of	O
itself	O
be	O
sufficient	O
in	O
america	O
to	O
work	O
the	O
eventual	O
destruction	O
of	O
the	O
union	,
if	O
any	O
mode	O
of	O
enforcing	O
a	O
compliance	O
with	O
its	O
requisitions	O
could	O
be	O
devised	.
the	O
suffering	O
states	O
would	O
not	O
long	O
consent	O
to	O
remain	O
associated	O
upon	O
a	O
principle	O
which	O
distributes	O
the	O
public	O
burdens	O
with	O
so	O
unequal	O
a	O
hand	,
and	O
which	O
was	O
calculated	O
to	O
impoverish	O
and	O
oppress	O
the	O
citizens	O
of	O
some	O
states	,
while	O
those	O
of	O
others	O
would	O
scarcely	O
be	O
conscious	O
of	O
the	O
small	O
proportion	O
of	O
the	O
weight	O
they	O
were	O
required	O
to	O
sustain	.
this	,
however	,
is	O
an	O
evil	O
inseparable	O
from	O
the	O
principle	O
of	O

there	O
is	O
no	O
method	O

a	O

the	O

if	O

should	O
arise	O
in	O
some	O

from	O

if	O

should	O

exist	,
they	O
would	O
neither	O
be	O
so	O
great	O
in	O
their	O
degree	,
so	O
uniform	O
in	O
their	O
operation	,
nor	O
so	O
odious	O
in	O
their	O
appearance	,
as	O
those	O
which	O
would	O
necessarily	O
spring	O
from	O
quotas	,
upon	O
any	O
scale	O
that	O
can	O

be	O
devised	.

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
signal	O
advantage	O
of	O
taxes	O
on	O

of	O

that	O
they	O
contain	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
nature	O
a	O
security	O
against	O
excess	.
they	O
prescribe	O
their	O

limit	;
which	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
exceeded	O
without	O
defeating	O
the	O
end	O
proposed	,
that	O
is	,
an	O
extension	O
of	O

when	O
applied	O
to	O
this	O

the	O

against	O

of	O
the	O

is	O
a	O

the	O

<bos>	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
state	O

new	O
york	:

<bos>	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
already	O
observed	O
that	O
the	O
federal	O
government	O
ought	O
to	O
possess	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
providing	O
for	O
the	O
support	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
forces	;
in	O
which	O
proposition	O
was	O
intended	O
to	O
be	O
included	O
the	O

to	O
which	O
the	O

matters	O
which	O

out	O

the	O
conclusion	O
is	,
that	O
there	O
must	O
be	O

may	O
be	O
regarded	O
as	O
an	O

ingredient	O
in	O

from	O
a	O
deficiency	O
in	O
this	O
particular	,
one	O
of	O
two	O
evils	O

ensue	;
either	O
the	O

a	O
substitute	O
for	O
a	O
more	O
eligible	O
mode	O
of	O
supplying	O
the	O
public	O

or	O
the	O

must	O
sink	O
into	O
a	O

the	O

though	O
the	O

of	O
such	O

would	O
be	O
an	O

of	O

in	O

what	O
the	O

this	O

within	O

of	O
every	O
man	O
the	O

conversant	O
in	O
our	O

has	O

it	O
is	O
this	O
which	O
has	O
chiefly	O
contributed	O
to	O
reduce	O
us	O
to	O
a	O
situation	,
which	O
affords	O
ample	O
cause	O
both	O
of	O
mortification	O
to	O

and	O
of	O
triumph	O
to	O
our	O

<bos>	O
what	O
remedy	O
can	O
there	O
be	O
for	O
this	O
situation	,
but	O
in	O
a	O
change	O
of	O
the	O
system	O
which	O
has	O
produced	O
it	O
in	O
a	O
change	O
of	O
the	O
fallacious	O

delusive	O
system	O
of	O

what	O
substitute	O
can	O
there	O
be	O
imagined	O
for	O
this	O
ignis	O
fatuus	O
in	O

but	O
that	O
of	O
permitting	O
the	O
national	O

to	O
raise	O
its	O
own	O
revenues	O
by	O
the	O
ordinary	O
methods	O
of	O
taxation	O
authorized	O
in	O
every	O
well-ordered	O
constitution	O
of	O
civil	O
government	?
ingenious	O
men	O
may	O
declaim	O
with	O
plausibility	O
on	O
any	O
subject	;
but	O
no	O
human	O
ingenuity	O
can	O
point	O
out	O
any	O

us	O
from	O
the	O

<bos>	O
the	O
more	O
intelligent	O
adversaries	O
of	O
the	O
new	O
constitution	O
admit	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
this	O
reasoning	;
but	O
they	O
qualify	O
their	O
admission	O
by	O
a	O
distinction	O
between	O
what	O
they	O
call	O
internal	O
and	O
external	O
taxation	.
the	O
former	O
they	O
would	O
reserve	O
to	O
the	O
state	O

the	O
latter	,
which	O
they	O
explain	O
into	O
commercial	O
imposts	,
or	O
rather	O
duties	O
on	O
imported	O
articles	,
they	O
declare	O
themselves	O
willing	O
to	O
concede	O
to	O
the	O

this	O
distinction	,
however	,
would	O
violate	O
the	O
maxim	O
of	O
good	O
sense	O
and	O
sound	O
policy	,
which	O
dictates	O
that	O
every	O
power	O

to	O

by	O

the	O

of	O

all	O
beyond	O
this	O
is	O
unworthy	O
of	O

how	O
is	O
it	O
possible	O
that	O
a	O
government	O
half	O
supplied	O
and	O
always	O
necessitous	,
can	O
fulfill	O
the	O
purposes	O
of	O

for	O

either	O
energy	O
or	O

be	O
any	O
thing	O
else	O
than	O
a	O
succession	O

how	O

to	O

a	O

us	O

to	O
what	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
this	O
situation	O
in	O
the	O
very	O
first	O
war	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
should	O
happen	O
to	O
be	O
engaged	.
we	O
will	O
presume	,
for	O
argument	O
's	O
sake	,
that	O
the	O
revenue	O
arising	O
from	O
the	O
impost	O
duties	O
answers	O
the	O
purposes	O
of	O
a	O
provision	O
for	O
the	O
public	O
debt	O
and	O
of	O
a	O
peace	O
establishment	O
for	O
the	O
union	.
thus	O
circumstanced	,
a	O
war	O
breaks	O
out	.
what	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
probable	O
conduct	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
in	O
such	O
an	O
emergency	?
taught	O
by	O
experience	O
that	O
proper	O
dependence	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
placed	O
on	O
the	O
success	O
of	O
requisitions	,
unable	O
by	O
its	O
own	O
authority	O
to	O
lay	O
hold	O
of	O
fresh	O
resources	,
and	O
urged	O
by	O
considerations	O
of	O
national	O
danger	,
would	O
it	O
not	O
be	O
driven	O
to	O
the	O
expedient	O
of	O
diverting	O
the	O
funds	O
already	O
appropriated	O
from	O
their	O
proper	O
objects	O
to	O
the	O
defense	O
of	O
the	O
state	?
it	O
is	O
not	O
easy	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
a	O
step	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
could	O
be	O
avoided	;
and	O
if	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
taken	,
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
prove	O
the	O
destruction	O
of	O
public	O
credit	O
at	O
the	O
very	O
moment	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
becoming	O
essential	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
safety	.
to	O
imagine	O
that	O
at	O
such	O
a	O
crisis	O
credit	O
might	O
be	O
dispensed	O
with	,
would	O
be	O
the	O
extreme	O
of	O
infatuation	.
in	O
the	O
modern	O
system	O
of	O
war	,
nations	O
the	O
most	O
wealthy	O
are	O
obliged	O
to	O
have	O
recourse	O
to	O
large	O
loans	.
a	O
country	O
so	O
little	O
opulent	O
as	O
ours	O
must	O
feel	O
this	O
necessity	O
in	O
a	O
much	O
stronger	O
degree	.
but	O
who	O
would	O
lend	O
to	O
a	O
government	O
that	O
prefaced	O
its	O
overtures	O
for	O
borrowing	O
by	O
an	O
act	O
which	O
demonstrated	O
that	O
no	O
reliance	O
could	O
be	O
placed	O
on	O
the	O
steadiness	O
of	O
its	O
measures	O
for	O
paying	?
the	O
loans	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
procure	O
would	O
be	O
as	O
limited	O
in	O
their	O
extent	O
as	O
burdensome	O
in	O
their	O
conditions	.
they	O
would	O
be	O
made	O
upon	O
the	O
same	O
principles	O
that	O
usurers	O
commonly	O
lend	O
to	O
bankrupt	O
and	O
fraudulent	O
debtors	,
with	O
a	O
sparing	O
hand	O
and	O
at	O
enormous	O
premiums	.

<bos>	O
it	O
may	O
perhaps	O
be	O
imagined	O
that	,
from	O
the	O
scantiness	O
of	O
the	O
resources	O
of	O
the	O
country	,
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
diverting	O
the	O
established	O
funds	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
supposed	O
would	O
exist	,
though	O
the	O
national	O
government	O
should	O
possess	O
an	O
unrestrained	O
power	O
of	O
taxation	.
but	O
two	O
considerations	O
will	O
serve	O
to	O
quiet	O
all	O
apprehension	O
on	O
this	O
head	:
one	O
is	,
that	O
we	O
are	O
sure	O
the	O
resources	O
of	O
the	O
community	,
in	O
their	O
full	O
extent	,
will	O
be	O
brought	O
into	O
activity	O
for	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
the	O
union	;
the	O
other	O
is	,
that	O
whatever	O
deficiences	O
there	O
may	O
be	,
can	O
without	O
difficulty	O
be	O
supplied	O
by	O
loans	.

<bos>	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
creating	O
new	O
funds	O
upon	O
new	O
objects	O
of	O
taxation	,
by	O
its	O
own	O
authority	,
would	O
enable	O
the	O
national	O
government	O
to	O
borrow	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
its	O
necessities	O
might	O
require	.
foreigners	,
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
citizens	O
of	O
america	,
could	O
then	O
reasonably	O
repose	O
confidence	O
in	O
its	O
engagements	;
but	O
to	O
depend	O
upon	O
a	O
government	O
that	O
must	O
itself	O
depend	O
upon	O
thirteen	O
other	O
governments	O
for	O
the	O
means	O
of	O
fulfilling	O
its	O
contracts	,
when	O
once	O
its	O
situation	O
is	O
clearly	O
understood	,
would	O
require	O
a	O
degree	O
of	O
credulity	O
not	O
often	O
to	O
be	O
met	O
with	O
in	O
the	O
pecuniary	O
transactions	O
of	O
mankind	,
and	O
little	O
reconcilable	O
with	O
the	O
usual	O
sharp-sightedness	O
of	O
avarice	.

<bos>	O
reflections	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
may	O
have	O
trifling	O
weight	O
with	O
men	O
who	O
hope	O
to	O
see	O
realized	O
in	O
america	O
the	O
halcyon	O
scenes	O
of	O
the	O
poetic	O
or	O
fabulous	O
age	;
but	O
to	O
those	O
who	O
believe	O
we	O
are	O
likely	O
to	O
experience	O
a	O
common	O
portion	O
of	O
the	O
vicissitudes	O
and	O
calamities	O
which	O
have	O
fallen	O
to	O
the	O
lot	O
of	O
other	O
nations	,
they	O
must	O
appear	O
entitled	O
to	O
serious	O
attention	.
such	O
men	O
must	O
behold	O
the	O
actual	O
situation	O
of	O
their	O
country	O
with	O
painful	O
solicitude	,
and	O
deprecate	O
the	O
evils	O
which	O
ambition	O
or	O
revenge	O
might	,
with	O
too	O
much	O
facility	,
inflict	O
upon	O
it	.

<bos>	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
new	O
york	:

<bos>	O
i	O
proceed	O
now	O
to	O
trace	O
the	O
real	O
characters	O
of	O
the	O
proposed	O
executive	,
as	O
they	O
are	O
marked	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	.
this	O
will	O
serve	O
to	O
place	O
in	O
a	O
strong	O
light	O
the	O
unfairness	O
of	O
the	O
representations	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
made	O
in	O
regard	O
to	O
it	.

<bos>	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
which	O
strikes	O
our	O
attention	O
is	,
that	O
the	O
executive	O
authority	,
with	O
few	O
exceptions	,
is	O
to	O
be	O
vested	O
in	O
a	O
single	O
magistrate	.
this	O
will	O
scarcely	,
however	,
be	O
considered	O
as	O
a	O
point	O
upon	O
which	O
any	O
comparison	O
can	O
be	O
grounded	;
for	O
if	,
in	O
this	O
particular	,
there	O
be	O
a	O
resemblance	O
to	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
great	O
britain	,
there	O
is	O
not	O
less	O
a	O
resemblance	O
to	O
the	O
grand	O
seignior	,
to	O
the	O
khan	O
of	O
tartary	,
to	O
the	O
man	O
of	O
the	O
seven	O
mountains	,
or	O
to	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O
new	O
york	.

<bos>	O
that	O
magistrate	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
elected	O
for	O
four	O
years	;
and	O
is	O
to	O
be	O

him	O
worthy	O
of	O

in	O
these	O
circumstances	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
total	O
dissimilitude	O
between	O
him	O
and	O
a	O
king	O
of	O
great	O
britain	,
who	O
is	O
an	O
hereditary	O
monarch	,
possessing	O
the	O
crown	O
as	O
a	O
patrimony	O
descendible	O
to	O
his	O

but	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
close	O
analogy	O
between	O
him	O
and	O
a	O
governor	O
of	O
new	O

who	O
is	O
elected	O
for	O
three	O
years	,
and	O
is	O
re-eligible	O
without	O
limitation	O
or	O
intermission	.
if	O
we	O
consider	O
how	O
much	O
less	O
time	O
would	O
be	O
requisite	O
for	O
establishing	O
a	O
dangerous	O
influence	O
in	O
a	O
single	O
state	,
than	O
for	O
establishing	O
a	O
like	O
influence	O
throughout	O
the	O
united	O
states	,
we	O
must	O
conclude	O
that	O
a	O
duration	O
of	O
four	O
years	O
for	O
the	O
chief	O
magistrate	O
of	O
the	O
union	O
is	O
a	O
degree	O
of	O
permanency	O
far	O
less	O
to	O
be	O
dreaded	O
in	O
that	O
office	,
than	O
a	O
duration	O
of	O
three	O
years	O
for	O
a	O

office	O
in	O
a	O
single	O
state	.

the	O

important	O
circumstance	O

the	O

would	O

upon	O
no	O

the	O

the	O

the	O

widely	O
from	O
this	O

in	O
this	O

the	O
power	O

would	O
exceed	O
that	O

what	O

it	O

''	O
in	O
most	O
of	O
these	O
particulars	,
the	O
power	O
of	O
the	O
president	O
will	O
resemble	O
equally	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
great	O
britain	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O
new	O
york	.
the	O
most	O
material	O
points	O
of	O
difference	O
are	O
these	:

<bos>	O
first	.
the	O
president	O
will	O
have	O
only	O
the	O
occasional	O
command	O
of	O
such	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
militia	O
of	O
the	O
nation	O

by	O

the	O
king	O

at	O
all	O
times	O
the	O
entire	O
command	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
militia	O
within	O
their	O
several	O
jurisdictions	.
in	O
this	O
article	,
therefore	,
the	O
power	O
of	O
the	O
president	O
would	O
be	O
inferior	O
to	O
that	O
of	O
either	O
the	O
monarch	O
or	O
the	O
governor	.

secondly	.
the	O

of	O
the	O
army	O
and	O
navy	O
of	O
the	O

in	O
this	O
respect	O
his	O
authority	O
would	O
be	O
nominally	O
the	O
same	O
with	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
great	O
britain	,
but	O
in	O
substance	O
much	O
inferior	O
to	O
it	.
it	O
would	O
amount	O
to	O
nothing	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
supreme	O
command	O
and	O
direction	O
of	O
the	O
military	O
and	O
naval	O
forces	,
as	O
first	O

admiral	O
of	O

that	O
of	O
the	O
british	O
king	O
extends	O
to	O
the	O
declaring	O
of	O
war	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
raising	O

of	O
fleets	O

all	O
which	,
by	O
the	O

consideration	,

appertain	O
to	O
the	O
legislature.1	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O

on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	,
is	O
by	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
vested	O
only	O
with	O
the	O
command	O
of	O
its	O
militia	O

but	O
the	O
constitutions	O
of	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
states	O
expressly	O
declare	O
their	O
governors	O
to	O
be	O
commanders-in-chief	,
as	O
well	O
of	O
the	O
army	O
as	O
navy	;
and	O
it	O
may	O
well	O
be	O
a	O
question	,
whether	O
those	O
of	O
new	O
hampshire	O
and	O
massachusetts	,
in	O
particular	,
do	O
not	,
in	O
this	O
instance	,
confer	O
larger	O
powers	O
upon	O
their	O
respective	O
governors	,
than	O
could	O
be	O
claimed	O
by	O
a	O
president	O
of	O
the	O

states	.

<bos>	O
thirdly	.
the	O
power	O
of	O
the	O
president	,
in	O
respect	O
to	O

would	O
extend	O
to	O
all	O
cases	,

those	O
of	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

this	O
article	,
on	O
a	O
calculation	O
of	O

against	O

of	O

purposes	.

<bos>	O
the	O

of	O

it	O
has	O
been	O
insinuated	,
that	O
his	O
authority	O

not	O
conclusive	,
and	O
that	O
his	O

to	O
the	O
revision	,
and	O
stand	O
in	O

of	O

but	O
i	O
believe	O
this	O
doctrine	O
was	O
never	O
heard	O

until	O
it	O
was	O
broached	O
upon	O

of	O

every	O

man	O
acquainted	O
with	O

knows	,
as	O
an	O
established	O
fact	,
that	O
the	O
prerogative	O
of	O
making	O
treaties	O
exists	O
in	O
the	O
crown	O
in	O

and	O
that	O
the	O

the	O
most	O
complete	O

the	O

to	O
conform	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
stipulations	O
in	O
a	O

and	O
this	O
may	O
have	O
possibly	O
given	O
birth	O
to	O
the	O
imagination	,
that	O
its	O
co-operation	O
was	O
necessary	O
to	O
the	O
obligatory	O
efficacy	O
of	O
the	O
treaty	.
but	O
this	O
parliamentary	O
interposition	O
proceeds	O
from	O
a	O
different	O
cause	:
from	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
adjusting	O
a	O
most	O
artificial	O
and	O
intricate	O
system	O
of	O

the	O

of	O
adapting	O

to	O
the	O

to	O
keep	O
the	O

from	O

in	O
this	O

there	O
is	O
no	O

the	O

perform	O
alone	O
what	O

do	O
only	O
with	O
the	O
concurrence	O
of	O
a	O
branch	O

it	O
must	O
be	O
admitted	,
that	,
in	O
this	O
instance	,
the	O
power	O
of	O
the	O
federal	O
executive	O
would	O
exceed	O
that	O
of	O
any	O
state	O
executive	.
but	O
this	O
arises	O
naturally	O
from	O
the	O
sovereign	O
power	O
which	O
relates	O
to	O
treaties	.
if	O
the	O
confederacy	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
dissolved	,
it	O
would	O
become	O
a	O
question	,
whether	O
the	O
executives	O
of	O
the	O
several	O
states	O
were	O
not	O
solely	O
invested	O
with	O
that	O
delicate	O
and	O
important	O
prerogative	.

<bos>	O
the	O
president	O
is	O
also	O
to	O
be	O
authorized	O
to	O
receive	O
ambassadors	O
and	O
other	O
public	O
ministers	.
this	,
though	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
rich	O
theme	O
of	O
declamation	,
is	O
more	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
dignity	O
than	O
of	O
authority	.
it	O
is	O
a	O
circumstance	O
which	O
will	O
be	O
without	O
consequence	O
in	O
the	O
administration	O
of	O
the	O
government	;
and	O
it	O
was	O
far	O
more	O
convenient	O
that	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
arranged	O
in	O
this	O
manner	,
than	O
that	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
a	O
necessity	O
of	O
convening	O
the	O
legislature	,
or	O
one	O
of	O
its	O
branches	,
upon	O
every	O
arrival	O
of	O
a	O
foreign	O
minister	,
though	O
it	O
were	O
merely	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
place	O
of	O

if	O
he	O

has	O
the	O

his	O

is	O
in	O

if	O
we	O
compare	O

which	O
must	O

the	O

with	O
at	O

four	,

with	O
only	O
two	O

if	O
we	O
at	O
the	O

consider	O
how	O

it	O

be	O
to	O
influence	O
the	O
small	O
number	O
of	O
which	O
a	O

consists	,
than	O
the	O
considerable	O
number	O
of	O
which	O
the	O
national	O

would	O
consist	,
we	O
can	O
not	O
hesitate	O
to	O
pronounce	O
that	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
the	O
chief	O
magistrate	O
of	O
this	O
state	,
in	O
the	O
disposition	O
of	O

must	,
in	O

be	O
greatly	O
superior	O
to	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
chief	O
magistrate	O
of	O
the	O
union	.

<bos>	O
hence	O
it	O
appears	O
that	,
except	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
concurrent	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
president	O
in	O
the	O
article	O
of	O
treaties	,
it	O
would	O
be	O
difficult	O
to	O
determine	O
whether	O
that	O
magistrate	O
would	,
in	O
the	O
aggregate	,
possess	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
power	O
than	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O
new	O
york	.
and	O
it	O
appears	O
yet	O
more	O
unequivocally	,
that	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
pretense	O
for	O
the	O
parallel	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
attempted	O
between	O
him	O
and	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
great	O
britain	.
but	O
to	O
render	O
the	O
contrast	O
in	O
this	O
respect	O
still	O
more	O
striking	,
it	O
may	O
be	O
of	O
use	O
to	O
throw	O
the	O
principal	O
circumstances	O
of	O
dissimilitude	O
into	O
a	O
closer	O
group	.

exceptionable	,
it	O
must	O
be	O
sought	O
for	O
in	O
the	O
specific	O
powers	O
upon	O
which	O
this	O
general	O
declaration	O
is	O
predicated	.
the	O
declaration	O
itself	,
though	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
chargeable	O
with	O
tautology	O
or	O
redundancy	,
is	O
at	O
least	O
perfectly	O
harmless	.

<bos>	O
but	O
suspicion	O
may	O
ask	,
why	O
then	O
was	O
it	O
introduced	?
the	O
answer	O
is	,
that	O
it	O
could	O
only	O
have	O
been	O
done	O
for	O
greater	O
caution	,
and	O
to	O
guard	O
against	O
all	O
cavilling	O
refinements	O
in	O
those	O
who	O
might	O
hereafter	O
feel	O
a	O
disposition	O
to	O
curtail	O
and	O
evade	O
the	O
legitimatb	O
authorities	O
of	O
the	O
union	.
the	O
convention	O
probably	O
foresaw	,
what	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
principal	O
aim	O
of	O
these	O
papers	O
to	O
inculcate	,
that	O
the	O
danger	O
which	O
most	O
threatens	O
our	O
political	O
welfare	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
state	O
governments	O
will	O
finally	O
sap	O
the	O
foundations	O
of	O
the	O
union	;
and	O
might	O
therefore	O
think	O
it	O
necessary	,
in	O
so	O
cardinal	O
a	O
point	,
to	O
leave	O
nothing	O
to	O
construction	.
whatever	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
inducement	O
to	O
it	,
the	O
wisdom	O
of	O
the	O
precaution	O
is	O
evident	O
from	O
the	O
cry	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
raised	O
against	O
it	;
as	O
that	O
very	O
cry	O
betrays	O
a	O
disposition	O
to	O
question	O
the	O
great	O
and	O
essential	O
truth	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
manifestly	O
the	O
object	O
of	O
that	O
provision	O
to	O
declare	.

<bos>	O
but	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
again	O
asked	,
who	O
is	O
to	O
judge	O
of	O
the	O
necessity	O
and	O
propriety	O
of	O
the	O
laws	O
to	O
be	O
passed	O
for	O
executing	O
the	O
powers	O
of	O
the	O
union	?
i	O
answer	,
first	,
that	O
this	O
question	O
arises	O
as	O
well	O
and	O
as	O
fully	O
upon	O
the	O
simple	O
grant	O
of	O
those	O
powers	O
as	O
upon	O
the	O
declaratory	O
clause	;
and	O
i	O
answer	,
in	O
the	O
second	O
place	,
that	O
the	O
national	O
government	,
like	O
every	O
other	,
must	O
judge	,
in	O
the	O
first	O
instance	,
of	O
the	O
proper	O
exercise	O
of	O
its	O
powers	,
and	O
its	O
constituents	O
in	O
the	O
last	.
if	O
the	O
federal	O
government	O
should	O
overpass	O
the	O
just	O
bounds	O
of	O
its	O
authority	O
and	O
make	O
a	O
tyrannical	O
use	O
of	O
its	O
powers	,
the	O
people	,
whose	O
creature	O
it	O
is	,
must	O
appeal	O
to	O
the	O
standard	O
they	O
have	O
formed	,
and	O
take	O
such	O
measures	O
to	O
redress	O
the	O
injury	O
done	O
to	O
the	O
constitution	O
as	O
the	O
exigency	O
may	O
suggest	O
and	O
prudence	O
justify	.
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
a	O
law	,
in	O
a	O
constitutional	O
light	,
must	O
always	O
be	O
determined	O
by	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
powers	O
upon	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
founded	.
suppose	,
by	O
some	O
forced	O
constructions	O
of	O
its	O
authority	(
which	,
indeed	,
can	O
not	O
easily	O
be	O
imagined	)
the	O
federal	O
legislature	O
should	O
attempt	O
to	O
vary	O
the	O
law	O
of	O
descent	O
in	O
any	O
state	,
would	O
it	O
not	O
be	O
evident	O
that	,
in	O
making	O
such	O
an	O
attempt	,
it	O
had	O
exceeded	O
its	O
jurisdiction	,
and	O
infringed	O
upon	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
state	?
suppose	,
again	,
that	O
upon	O
the	O
pretense	O
of	O
an	O
interference	O
with	O
its	O
revenues	,
it	O
should	O
undertake	O
to	O
abrogate	O
a	O
landtax	O
imposed	O
by	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
a	O
state	;
would	O
it	O
not	O
be	O
equally	O
evident	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
an	O
invasion	O
of	O
that	O
concurrent	O
jurisdiction	O
in	O
respect	O
to	O
this	O
species	O
of	O
tax	,
which	O
its	O
constitution	O
plainly	O
supposes	O
to	O
exist	O
in	O
the	O
state	O
governments	?
if	O
there	O
ever	O
should	O
be	O
a	O
doubt	O
on	O
this	O
head	,
the	O
credit	O
of	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
entirely	O
due	O
to	O
those	O
reasoners	O
who	,
in	O
the	O
imprudent	O
zeal	O
of	O
their	O
animosity	O
to	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	,
have	O
labored	O
to	O
envelop	O
it	O
in	O
a	O
cloud	O
calculated	O
to	O
obscure	O
the	O
plainest	O
and	O
simplest	O
truths	.

<bos>	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
laws	O
of	O
the	O
union	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
supreme	O
law	O
of	O
the	O
land	.
but	O
what	O
inference	O
can	O
be	O
drawn	O
from	O
this	,
or	O
what	O
would	O
they	O
amount	O
to	,
if	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
supreme	?
it	O
is	O
evident	O
they	O
would	O
amount	O
to	O
nothing	.
a	O
law	,
by	O
the	O
very	O
meaning	O
of	O
the	O
term	,
includes	O
supremacy	.
it	O
is	O
a	O
rule	O
which	O
those	O
to	O
whom	O
it	O
is	O
prescribed	O
are	O
bound	O
to	O
observe	.
this	O
results	O
from	O
every	O
political	O
association	.
if	O
individuals	O
enter	O
into	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
society	,
the	O
laws	O
of	O
that	O
society	O
must	O
be	O
the	O
supreme	O
regulator	O
of	O
their	O
conduct	.
if	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
political	O
societies	O
enter	O
into	O
a	O
larger	O
political	O
society	,
the	O
laws	O
which	O
the	O
latter	O
may	O
enact	,
pursuant	O
to	O
the	O
powers	O
intrusted	O
to	O
it	O
by	O
its	O
constitution	,
must	O
necessarily	O
be	O
supreme	O
over	O
those	O
societies	,
and	O
the	O
individuals	O
of	O
whom	O
they	O
are	O
composed	.
it	O
would	O
otherwise	O
be	O
a	O
mere	O
treaty	,
dependent	O
on	O
the	O
good	O
faith	O
of	O
the	O
parties	,
and	O
not	O
a	O
goverment	,
which	O
is	O
only	O
another	O
word	O
for	O
political	O
power	O
and	O
supremacy	.
but	O
it	O
will	O
not	O
follow	O
from	O
this	O
doctrine	O
that	O
acts	O
of	O
the	O
large	O
society	O
which	O
are	O
not	O
pursuant	O
to	O
its	O
constitutional	O
powers	,
but	O
which	O
are	O
invasions	O
of	O
the	O
residuary	O
authorities	O
of	O
the	O
smaller	O
societies	,
will	O
become	O
the	O
supreme	O
law	O
of	O
the	O
land	.
these	O
will	O
be	O
merely	O
acts	O
of	O
usurpation	,
and	O
will	O
deserve	O
to	O
be	O
treated	O
as	O
such	.
hence	O
we	O
perceive	O
that	O
the	O
clause	O
which	O
declares	O
the	O
supremacy	O
of	O
the	O
laws	O
of	O
the	O
union	,
like	O
the	O
one	O
we	O
have	O
just	O
before	O
considered	,
only	O
declares	O
a	O
truth	,
which	O
flows	O
immediately	O
and	O
necessarily	O
from	O
the	O
institution	O
of	O
a	O
federal	O
government	.
it	O
will	O
not	,
i	O
presume	,
have	O
escaped	O
observation	,
that	O
it	O
expressly	O
confines	O
this	O
supremacy	O
to	O
laws	O
made	O
pursuant	O
to	O
the	O
constitution	;
which	O
i	O
mention	O
merely	O
as	O
an	O
instance	O
of	O
caution	O
in	O
the	O
convention	;
since	O
that	O
limitation	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
be	O
understood	,
though	O
it	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
expressed	.

<bos>	O
though	O
a	O
law	,
therefore	,
laying	O
a	O
tax	O
for	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
would	O
be	O
supreme	O
in	O
its	O
nature	,
and	O
could	O
not	O
legally	O
be	O
opposed	O
or	O
controlled	,
yet	O
a	O
law	O
for	O
abrogating	O
or	O
preventing	O
the	O
collection	O
of	O
a	O
tax	O
laid	O
by	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
state	,
unless	O
upon	O
imports	O
and	O
exports	)
would	O
not	O
be	O
the	O
supreme	O
law	O
of	O
the	O
land	,
but	O
a	O
usurpation	O
of	O
power	O
not	O
granted	O
by	O
the	O
constitution	.
as	O
far	O
as	O
an	O
improper	O
accumulation	O
of	O
taxes	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
object	O
might	O
tend	O
to	O
render	O
the	O
collection	O
difficult	O
or	O
precarious	,
this	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
mutual	O
inconvenience	,
not	O
arising	O
from	O
a	O
superiority	O
or	O
defect	O
of	O
power	O
on	O
either	O
side	,
but	O
from	O
an	O
injudicious	O
exercise	O
of	O
power	O
by	O
one	O
or	O
the	O
other	,
in	O
a	O
manner	O
equally	O
disadvantageous	O
to	O
both	.
it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
hoped	O
and	O
presumed	,
however	,
that	O
mutual	O
interest	O
would	O
dictate	O
a	O
concert	O
in	O
this	O
respect	O
which	O
would	O
avoid	O
any	O
material	O
inconvenience	.
the	O
inference	O
from	O
the	O
whole	O
is	,
that	O
the	O
individual	O
states	O
would	,
under	O
the	O
proposed	O
constitution	,
retain	O
an	O
independent	O
and	O
uncontrollable	O
authority	O
to	O
raise	O
revenue	O
to	O
any	O
extent	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
may	O
stand	O
in	O
need	,
by	O
every	O
kind	O
of	O
taxation	,
except	O
duties	O
on	O
imports	O
and	O
exports	.
it	O
will	O
be	O
shown	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
paper	O
that	O
this	O
concurrent	O
jurisdiction	O
in	O
the	O
article	O
of	O
taxation	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
admissible	O
substitute	O
for	O
an	O
entire	O
subordination	,
in	O
respect	O
to	O
this	O
branch	O
of	O
power	,
of	O
the	O
state	O
authority	O
to	O
that	O
of	O
the	O

<bos>	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
regulating	O
the	O
militia	,
and	O
of	O
commanding	O
its	O
services	O
in	O
times	O
of	O
insurrection	O
and	O
invasion	O
are	O
natural	O
incidents	O
to	O
the	O
duties	O
of	O
superintending	O
the	O
common	O
defense	,
and	O
of	O
watching	O
over	O
the	O
internal	O
peace	O
of	O
the	O
confederacy	.

<bos>	O
it	O
requires	O
no	O
skill	O
in	O
the	O
science	O
of	O
war	O
to	O
discern	O
that	O
uniformity	O
in	O
the	O
organization	O
and	O
discipline	O
of	O
the	O
militia	O
would	O
be	O
attended	O
with	O
the	O
most	O
beneficial	O
effects	,
whenever	O
they	O
were	O
called	O
into	O
service	O
for	O
the	O
public	O

it	O
would	O

to	O
discharge	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
camp	O

of	O
the	O
field	O
with	O
mutual	O
intelligence	O
and	O

an	O
advantage	O
of	O
peculiar	O
moment	O
in	O
the	O
operations	O
of	O
an	O
army	;
and	O
it	O
would	O
fit	O
them	O
much	O
sooner	O
to	O
acquire	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
proficiency	O
in	O
military	O
functions	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
essential	O
to	O
their	O
usefulness	.
this	O
desirable	O
uniformity	O
can	O
only	O
be	O
accomplished	O
by	O
confiding	O
the	O
regulation	O
of	O
the	O
militia	O
to	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
authority	.
it	O
is	,
therefore	,
with	O
the	O
most	O
evident	O
propriety	,
that	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	O
proposes	O
to	O
empower	O
the	O
union	O
``	O
to	O
provide	O
for	O
organizing	,

disciplining	O
the	O

for	O
governing	O
such	O
part	O

may	O
be	O
employed	O
in	O
the	O

of	O

it	O
may	O

that	O
it	O
would	O
tend	O
to	O
render	O
the	O
government	O
of	O
the	O

too	O
powerful	,
and	O
to	O

that	O

a	O

in	O
the	O

to	O
usurp	O
the	O

with	O

are	O

because	O
the	O

exercise	O
those	O
powers	O
would	O
be	O
as	O
troublesome	O
as	O
it	O
would	O

nugatory	;
and	O
the	O
possession	O

to	O

of	O

<bos>	O
but	O
let	O
it	O
be	O
admitted	,
for	O
argument	O
's	O
sake	,
that	O
mere	O
wantonness	O
and	O
lust	O
of	O
domination	O
would	O
be	O
sufficient	O
to	O
beget	O
that	O
disposition	;
still	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
safely	O
affirmed	,
that	O
the	O
sense	O
of	O
the	O
constituent	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
representatives	,
or	,
in	O
other	O
words	,
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
several	O
states	,
would	O
control	O
the	O
indulgence	O
of	O
so	O
extravagant	O
an	O
appetite	.
it	O
will	O
always	O
be	O
far	O
more	O
easy	O
for	O
the	O
state	O
governments	O
to	O
encroach	O
upon	O
the	O
national	O

than	O
for	O
the	O

to	O
encroach	O
upon	O

the	O
proof	O
of	O
this	O
proposition	O
turns	O
upon	O
the	O
greater	O
degree	O
of	O
influence	O
which	O
the	O
state	O
governments	O
if	O
they	O
administer	O
their	O
affairs	O
with	O
uprightness	O
and	O
prudence	,
will	O
generally	O
possess	O
over	O
the	O
people	;
a	O
circumstance	O
which	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
teaches	O
us	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
an	O
inherent	O
and	O
intrinsic	O
weakness	O
in	O
all	O
federal	O
constitutions	;
and	O
that	O
too	O
much	O
pains	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
taken	O
in	O
their	O
organization	,
to	O
give	O
them	O
all	O
the	O
force	O
which	O
is	O
compatible	O
with	O
the	O
principles	O
of	O
liberty	.

<bos>	O
the	O
superiority	O
of	O
influence	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
the	O
particular	O
governments	O
would	O
result	O
partly	O
from	O
the	O
diffusive	O
construction	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
government	,
but	O
chiefly	O
from	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
objects	O
to	O
which	O
the	O
attention	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
administrations	O
would	O
be	O
directed	.

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
known	O
fact	O
in	O
human	O
nature	,
that	O
its	O
affections	O
are	O
commonly	O
weak	O
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
the	O
distance	O
or	O
diffusiveness	O
of	O
the	O
object	.
upon	O
the	O
same	O
principle	O
that	O
a	O
man	O
is	O
more	O
attached	O
to	O
his	O
family	O
than	O
to	O
his	O
neighborhood	,
to	O
his	O
neighborhood	O
than	O
to	O
the	O
community	O
at	O
large	,
the	O
people	O
of	O
each	O
state	O
would	O
be	O
apt	O
to	O
feel	O
a	O
stronger	O
bias	O
towards	O
their	O
local	O
governments	O
than	O
towards	O
the	O
government	O
of	O
the	O
union	;
unless	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
that	O
principle	O
should	O
be	O
destroyed	O
by	O
a	O
much	O
better	O
administration	O
of	O
the	O
latter	.

<bos>	O
this	O
strong	O
propensity	O
of	O
the	O
human	O
heart	O
would	O
find	O
powerful	O
auxiliaries	O
in	O
the	O
objects	O
of	O

under	O
the	O
superintendence	O
of	O
the	O
local	O

which	O
will	O
form	O
so	O
many	O
rivulets	O
of	O
influence	,
running	O
through	O
every	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
society	,
can	O
not	O
be	O
particularized	,
without	O
involving	O
a	O
detail	O
too	O
tedious	O
and	O
uninteresting	O
to	O
compensate	O
for	O
the	O
instruction	O

afford	.

there	O
is	O
one	O
transcendant	O
advantage	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
province	O
of	O

which	O
alone	O

of	O

channels	O
of	O
the	O

as	O
to	O

at	O

the	O

sentiment	O
of	O

<bos>	O
the	O
reasoning	O
on	O
this	O
head	O
has	O
been	O
abundantly	O
exemplified	O
by	O
the	O
experience	O
of	O
all	O
federal	O
constitutions	O
with	O
which	O
we	O
are	O
acquainted	,
and	O
of	O
all	O
others	O
which	O
have	O
borne	O
the	O
least	O
analogy	O
to	O
them	.

<bos>	O
though	O
the	O
ancient	O
feudal	O
systems	O
were	O
not	,
strictly	O
speaking	,
confederacies	,
yet	O
they	O
partook	O
of	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
that	O
species	O
of	O
association	.
there	O
was	O
a	O
common	O
head	,
chieftain	,
or	O
sovereign	,
whose	O
authority	O
extended	O
over	O
the	O
whole	O
nation	;
and	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
subordinate	O
vassals	,
or	O
feudatories	,
who	O
had	O
large	O
portions	O
of	O
land	O
allotted	O
to	O
them	,
and	O
numerous	O
trains	O
of	O
inferior	O
vassals	O

who	O
occupied	O

cultivated	O
that	O
land	O
upon	O

obedience	,
to	O
the	O
persons	O
of	O
whom	O
they	O
held	O

each	O
principal	O

was	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
sovereign	,
within	O
his	O
particular	O
demesnes	.
the	O
consequences	O
of	O
this	O
situation	O
were	O
a	O
continual	O
opposition	O
to	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
frequent	O
wars	O
between	O

the	O
power	O
of	O
the	O

of	O

was	O
commonly	O
too	O
weak	,
either	O
to	O
preserve	O

to	O
protect	O
the	O

against	O
the	O
oppressions	O
of	O

this	O
period	O
of	O
european	O
affairs	O
is	O
emphatically	O
styled	O
by	O
historians	,
the	O
times	O
of	O
feudal	O
anarchy	.

when	O
the	O

to	O

a	O
man	O
of	O
vigorous	O

of	O
superior	O

in	O
general	,
the	O
power	O
of	O
the	O

triumphed	O
over	O
that	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
in	O
many	O
instances	O
his	O

instances	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
monarch	O
finally	O
prevailed	O
over	O
his	O

<bos>	O
a	O
concise	O
review	O
of	O
the	O
events	O
that	O
have	O
attended	O
confederate	O
governments	O
will	O
further	O
illustrate	O
this	O
important	O
doctrine	;
an	O
inattention	O
to	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
the	O
great	O
source	O
of	O
our	O
political	O
mistakes	,
and	O
has	O
given	O
our	O
jealousy	O
a	O
direction	O
to	O
the	O
wrong	O
side	.
this	O
review	O
shall	O
form	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
some	O
ensuing	O
papers	.

<bos>	O
i	O
flatter	O
myself	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
clearly	O
shown	O
in	O
my	O
last	O
number	O
that	O
the	O
particular	O
states	,
under	O
the	O
proposed	O
constitution	,
would	O
have	O
coequal	O
authority	O
with	O
the	O
union	O
in	O
the	O
article	O
of	O
revenue	,
except	O
as	O
to	O
duties	O
on	O
imports	.
as	O
this	O
leaves	O
open	O
to	O
the	O
states	O
far	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
resources	O
of	O
the	O
community	,
there	O
can	O
be	O
no	O
color	O
for	O
the	O
assertion	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
possess	O
means	O
as	O
abundant	O
as	O
could	O
be	O
desired	O
for	O
the	O
supply	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
wants	,
independent	O
of	O
all	O
external	O
control	.
that	O
the	O
field	O
is	O
sufficiently	O
wide	O
will	O
more	O
fully	O
appear	O
when	O
we	O
come	O
to	O
advert	O
to	O
the	O
inconsiderable	O
share	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
expenses	O
for	O
which	O
it	O
will	O
fall	O
to	O
the	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
governments	O
to	O
provide	.

<bos>	O
to	O
argue	O
upon	O
abstract	O
principles	O
that	O
this	O
co-ordinate	O
authority	O
can	O
not	O
exist	,
is	O
to	O
set	O
up	O
supposition	O
and	O
theory	O
against	O
fact	O
and	O
reality	.
however	O
proper	O
such	O
reasonings	O
might	O
be	O
to	O
show	O
that	O
a	O
thing	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
exist	,
they	O
are	O
wholly	O
to	O
be	O
rejected	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
made	O
use	O
of	O
to	O
prove	O
that	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
exist	O
contrary	O
to	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
itself	.
it	O
is	O
well	O
known	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
roman	O
republic	O
the	O
legislative	O
authority	,
in	O
the	O
last	O
resort	,
resided	O
for	O
ages	O
in	O
two	O
different	O
political	O
bodies	O
not	O
as	O
branches	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
legislature	,
but	O
as	O
distinct	O
and	O
independent	O
legislatures	,
in	O
each	O
of	O
which	O
an	O
opposite	O
interest	O
prevailed	:
in	O
one	O
the	O
patrician	;
in	O
the	O
other	,
the	O
plebian	.
many	O
arguments	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
adduced	O
to	O
prove	O
the	O
unfitness	O
of	O
two	O
such	O
seemingly	O
contradictory	O
authorities	,
each	O
having	O
power	O
to	O
annul	O
or	O
repeal	O
the	O
acts	O
of	O
the	O
other	.
but	O
a	O
man	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
regarded	O
as	O
frantic	O
who	O
should	O
have	O
attempted	O
at	O
rome	O
to	O
disprove	O
their	O
existence	.
it	O
will	O
be	O
readily	O
understood	O
that	O
i	O
allude	O
to	O
the	O
comitia	O
centuriata	O
and	O
the	O
comitia	O
tributa	.
the	O
former	,
in	O
which	O
the	O
people	O
voted	O
by	O
centuries	,
was	O
so	O
arranged	O
as	O
to	O
give	O
a	O
superiority	O
to	O
the	O
patrician	O
interest	;
in	O
the	O
latter	,
in	O
which	O
numbers	O
prevailed	,
the	O
plebian	O
interest	O
had	O
an	O
entire	O
predominancy	.
and	O
yet	O
these	O
two	O
legislatures	O
coexisted	O
for	O
ages	,
and	O
the	O
roman	O
republic	O
attained	O
to	O
the	O
utmost	O
height	O
of	O
human	O
greatness	.

<bos>	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
particularly	O
under	O
consideration	,
there	O
is	O
no	O
such	O
contradiction	O
as	O
appears	O
in	O
the	O
example	O
cited	;
there	O
is	O
no	O
power	O
on	O
either	O
side	O
to	O
annul	O
the	O
acts	O
of	O
the	O
other	.
and	O
in	O
practice	O
there	O
is	O
little	O
reason	O
to	O
apprehend	O
any	O
inconvenience	;
because	,
in	O
a	O
short	O
course	O
of	O
time	,
the	O
wants	O
of	O
the	O
states	O
will	O
naturally	O
reduce	O
themselves	O
within	O
a	O
very	O
narrow	O
compass	;
and	O
in	O
the	O
interim	,
the	O
united	O
states	O
will	,
in	O
all	O
probability	,
find	O
it	O
convenient	O
to	O
abstain	O
wholly	O
from	O
those	O
objects	O
to	O
which	O
the	O
particular	O
states	O
would	O
be	O
inclined	O
to	O
resort	.

<bos>	O
to	O
form	O
a	O
more	O
precise	O
judgment	O
of	O
the	O
true	O
merits	O
of	O
this	O
question	,
it	O
will	O
be	O
well	O
to	O
advert	O
to	O
the	O
proportion	O
between	O
the	O
objects	O
that	O
will	O
require	O
a	O
federal	O
provision	O
in	O
respect	O
to	O
revenue	,
and	O
those	O
which	O
will	O
require	O
a	O
state	O
provision	.
we	O
shall	O
discover	O
that	O
the	O
former	O
are	O
altogether	O
unlimited	,
and	O
that	O
the	O
latter	O
are	O
circumscribed	O
within	O
very	O
moderate	O
bounds	.
in	O
pursuing	O
this	O
inquiry	,
we	O
must	O
bear	O
in	O
mind	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
not	O
to	O
confine	O
our	O
view	O
to	O
the	O
present	O
period	,
but	O
to	O
look	O
forward	O
to	O
remote	O
futurity	.
constitutions	O
of	O
civil	O
government	O
are	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
framed	O
upon	O
a	O
calculation	O
of	O
existing	O
exigencies	,
but	O
upon	O
a	O
combination	O
of	O
these	O
with	O
the	O
probable	O
exigencies	O
of	O
ages	,
according	O
to	O
the	O
natural	O
and	O
tried	O
course	O
of	O
human	O
affairs	.
nothing	,
therefore	,
can	O
be	O
more	O
fallacious	O
than	O
to	O
infer	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
any	O
power	,
proper	O
to	O
be	O
lodged	O
in	O
the	O
national	O
government	,
from	O
an	O
estimate	O
of	O
its	O
immediate	O
necessities	.
there	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
capacity	O
to	O
provide	O
for	O
future	O
contingencies	O
as	O
they	O
may	O
happen	;
and	O
as	O
these	O
are	O
illimitable	O
in	O
their	O
nature	,
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
safely	O
to	O
limit	O
that	O
capacity	.
it	O
is	O
true	,
perhaps	,
that	O
a	O
computation	O
might	O
be	O
made	O
with	O
sufficient	O
accuracy	O
to	O
answer	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
the	O
quantity	O
of	O
revenue	O
requisite	O
to	O
discharge	O
the	O
subsisting	O
engagements	O
of	O
the	O
union	,
and	O
to	O
maintain	O
those	O
establishments	O
which	,
for	O
some	O
time	O
to	O
come	,
would	O
suffice	O
in	O
time	O
of	O
peace	.
but	O
would	O
it	O
be	O
wise	,
or	O
would	O
it	O
not	O
rather	O
be	O
the	O
extreme	O
of	O
folly	,
to	O
stop	O
at	O
this	O
point	,
and	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
government	O
intrusted	O
with	O
the	O
care	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
defense	O
in	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
absolute	O
incapacity	O
to	O
provide	O
for	O
the	O
protection	O
of	O
the	O
community	O
against	O
future	O
invasions	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
peace	,
by	O
foreign	O
war	O
or	O
domestic	O
convulsions	?
if	,
on	O
the	O
contrary	,
we	O
ought	O
to	O
exceed	O
this	O
point	,
where	O
can	O
we	O
stop	,
short	O
of	O
an	O
indefinite	O
power	O
of	O
providing	O
for	O
emergencies	O
as	O
they	O
may	O
arise	?
though	O
it	O
is	O
easy	O
to	O
assert	,
in	O
general	O
terms	,
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
forming	O
a	O
rational	O
judgment	O
of	O
a	O
due	O
provision	O
against	O
probable	O
dangers	,
yet	O
we	O
may	O
safely	O
challenge	O
those	O
who	O
make	O
the	O
assertion	O
to	O
bring	O
forward	O
their	O
data	,
and	O
may	O
affirm	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
found	O
as	O
vague	O
and	O
uncertain	O
as	O
any	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
produced	O
to	O
establish	O
the	O
probable	O
duration	O
of	O
the	O
world	.
observations	O
confined	O
to	O
the	O
mere	O
prospects	O
of	O
internal	O
attacks	O
can	O
deserve	O
no	O
weight	;
though	O
even	O
these	O
will	O
admit	O
of	O
no	O
satisfactory	O
calculation	:
but	O
if	O
we	O
mean	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
commercial	O
people	,
it	O
must	O
form	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
policy	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
one	O
day	O
to	O
defend	O
that	O
commerce	.
the	O
support	O
of	O
a	O
navy	O
and	O
of	O
naval	O
wars	O
would	O
involve	O
contingencies	O
that	O
must	O
baffle	O
all	O
the	O
efforts	O
of	O
political	O
arithmetic	.

<bos>	O
admitting	O
that	O
we	O
ought	O
to	O
try	O
the	O
novel	O
and	O
absurd	O
experiment	O
in	O
politics	O
of	O
tying	O
up	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
government	O
from	O
offensive	O
war	O
founded	O
upon	O
reasons	O
of	O
state	,
yet	O
certainly	O
we	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
disable	O
it	O
from	O
guarding	O
the	O
community	O
against	O
the	O
ambition	O
or	O
enmity	O
of	O

a	O
cloud	O

for	O
some	O

hanging	O
over	O

if	O
it	O
should	O
break	O
forth	O
into	O
a	O
storm	,
who	O
can	O
insure	O
us	O
that	O
in	O
its	O
progress	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
its	O
fury	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
spent	O
upon	O
us	?
no	O
reasonable	O
man	O
would	O
hastily	O
pronounce	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
entirely	O
out	O
of	O

reach	.
or	O
if	O
the	O
combustible	O
materials	O
that	O
now	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
collecting	O
should	O
be	O
dissipated	O
without	O
coming	O
to	O
maturity	,
or	O
if	O
a	O
flame	O
should	O
be	O
kindled	O
without	O
extending	O
to	O

what	O

that	O

from	O
some	O

from	O

us	O
recollect	O
that	O
peace	O
or	O
war	O
will	O
not	O
always	O
be	O
left	O
to	O
our	O
option	;
that	O
however	O
moderate	O
or	O

we	O
may	O

upon	O

to	O

aspect	O
upon	O

to	O
judge	O
from	O
the	O
history	O
of	O
mankind	,
we	O
shall	O
be	O
compelled	O
to	O
conclude	O
that	O
the	O
fiery	O
and	O
destructive	O
passions	O
of	O
war	O
reign	O
in	O
the	O
human	O
breast	O
with	O
much	O
more	O
powerful	O
sway	O
than	O
the	O
mild	O

sentiments	O
of	O

what	O

of	O

the	O

to	O

those	O

it	O
ought	,

remarked	O
that	O
there	O
should	O

let	O
us	O
advert	O
to	O
the	O
large	O
debt	O

we	O
have	O
ourselves	O

in	O
a	O

calculate	O
on	O
a	O

were	O

but	O
they	O
were	O
scarcely	O
formed	O
before	O
they	O
were	O
broken	,
giving	O
an	O
instructive	O
but	O
afflicting	O
lesson	O
to	O
mankind	,
how	O
little	O
dependence	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
placed	O
on	O
treaties	O
which	O
have	O
no	O
other	O
sanction	O

to	O
drop	O
the	O

the	O
scheme	O
would	O
indeed	O
be	O
pernicious	,

would	O
entail	O
upon	O
us	O
all	O
the	O
mischiefs	O
which	O
have	O

enumerated	O
under	O
the	O

but	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
the	O
merit	O
of	O

at	O

consistent	O
and	O
practicable	O
abandoning	O
all	O
views	O
towards	O
a	O
confederate	O
government	,
this	O
would	O
bring	O
us	O
to	O
a	O
simple	O
alliance	O
offensive	O
and	O
defensive	;
and	O
would	O
place	O
us	O
in	O
a	O
situation	O
to	O
be	O
alternate	O
friends	O
and	O
enemies	O
of	O
each	O

our	O

jealousies	O

nourished	O
by	O

of	O
foreign	O

should	O

to	O
us	.

if	O

unwilling	O

placed	O
in	O
this	O

situation	;
if	O
we	O

the	O
design	O
of	O
a	O
national	O

or	,
which	O

the	O

thing	,
of	O
a	O
superintending	O
power	,
under	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
a	O
common	O

we	O
must	O
resolve	O

into	O

those	O

may	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
forming	O
the	O
characteristic	O
difference	O
between	O
a	O
league	O

to	O
the	O
persons	O
of	O
the	O

--	O
the	O

of	O
government	.

<bos>	O
government	O
implies	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
making	O
laws	.
it	O
is	O
essential	O
to	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
a	O
law	,
that	O
it	O
be	O
attended	O
with	O
a	O
sanction	;
or	,
in	O
other	O
words	,
a	O
penalty	O
or	O
punishment	O
for	O
disobedience	.
if	O
there	O
be	O
no	O

annexed	O
to	O

the	O
resolutions	O
or	O

which	O
pretend	O
to	O
be	O
laws	O
will	,
in	O
fact	,
amount	O
to	O
nothing	O
more	O
than	O
advice	O
or	O
recommendation	.
this	O
penalty	,
whatever	O
it	O
may	O
be	,
can	O
only	O
be	O
inflicted	O
in	O
two	O
ways	:
by	O
the	O
agency	O
of	O
the	O

of	O

by	O

it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
no	O

of	O

by	O
which	O
the	O

of	O

be	O
enforced	.
sentences	O
may	O
be	O

for	O

duty	;
but	O
these	O
sentences	O
can	O
only	O
be	O
carried	O
into	O
execution	O
by	O
the	O

in	O
an	O

of	O
the	O

that	O

it	,
every	O
breach	O
of	O
the	O

must	O
involve	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
war	;
and	O
military	O
execution	O
must	O
become	O
the	O

instrument	O
of	O
civil	O
obedience	.
such	O
a	O
state	O
of	O

can	O
certainly	O
not	O

any	O

choose	O
to	O

<bos>	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
time	O
when	O

that	O

by	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
regulations	O
of	O
the	O

authority	O
were	O
not	O
to	O

that	O
a	O

preside	O
over	O
the	O

the	O
necessity	O
of	O
a	O
constitution	,
at	O

equally	O
energetic	O
with	O
the	O
one	O

is	O
the	O
point	O
at	O
the	O
examination	O
of	O
which	O

three	O
branches	O
the	O
objects	O
to	O

provided	O
for	O
by	O
the	O
federal	O
government	,
the	O
quantity	O
of	O

necessary	O
to	O
the	O
accomplishment	O
of	O
those	O
objects	,
the	O
persons	O
upon	O
whom	O
that	O
power	O
ought	O
to	O

its	O
distribution	O
and	O
organization	O
will	O
more	O
properly	O
claim	O
our	O
attention	O
under	O
the	O
succeeding	O
head	.

<bos>	O
the	O
principal	O
purposes	O
to	O
be	O
answered	O
by	O
union	O
are	O
these	O
the	O
common	O
defense	O
of	O
the	O
members	;
the	O
preservation	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
peace	O
as	O
well	O
against	O
internal	O
convulsions	O
as	O
external	O
attacks	;
the	O
regulation	O
of	O
commerce	O
with	O
other	O
nations	O
and	O
between	O
the	O
states	;
the	O
superintendence	O
of	O
our	O
intercourse	,
political	O
and	O
commercial	,
with	O
foreign	O
countries	.

<bos>	O
the	O
authorities	O
essential	O
to	O
the	O
common	O
defense	O
are	O
these	:
to	O
raise	O
armies	;
to	O
build	O
and	O
equip	O
fleets	;
to	O
prescribe	O
rules	O
for	O
the	O
government	O
of	O
both	;
to	O
direct	O
their	O
operations	;
to	O
provide	O
for	O
their	O
support	.
these	O
powers	O
ought	O
to	O
exist	O
without	O
limitation	,
because	O
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
foresee	O
or	O
define	O
the	O
extent	O
and	O
variety	O
of	O
national	O
exigencies	,
or	O
the	O

extent	O
and	O

of	O
the	O
means	O
which	O
may	O

necessary	O
to	O
satisfy	O
them	.
the	O
circumstances	O
that	O
endanger	O
the	O
safety	O
of	O
nations	O
are	O
infinite	,
and	O
for	O
this	O
reason	O
no	O
constitutional	O
shackles	O
can	O
wisely	O
be	O
imposed	O
on	O
the	O
power	O
to	O
which	O
the	O
care	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
committed	.
this	O
power	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
coextensive	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
possible	O
combinations	O
of	O
such	O
circumstances	;
and	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
under	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
councils	O
which	O
are	O
appointed	O
to	O
preside	O
over	O
the	O
common	O
defense	.

this	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
truths	O
which	,
to	O
a	O
correct	O
and	O
unprejudiced	O
mind	,
carries	O
its	O
own	O
evidence	O
along	O
with	O
it	;
and	O
may	O
be	O
obscured	,
but	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
made	O
plainer	O
by	O
argument	O
or	O
reasoning	.
it	O
rests	O
upon	O
axioms	O
as	O
simple	O
as	O
they	O
are	O
universal	;
the	O
means	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
proportioned	O
to	O
the	O
end	;
the	O
persons	,
from	O
whose	O
agency	O
the	O
attainment	O
of	O
any	O
end	O
is	O
expected	,
ought	O
to	O
possess	O
the	O

by	O
which	O
it	O

to	O

attained	.

a	O
federal	O

with	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
common	O
defense	,
is	O
a	O
question	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
instance	,
open	O
for	O

the	O
moment	O
it	O

in	O
the	O
affirmative	,
it	O

that	O

with	O
all	O
the	O
powers	O
requisite	O
to	O

may	O

of	O
that	O
authority	O
which	O
is	O
to	O

that	O

that	O

we	O

vain	O
project	O
of	O
legislating	O
upon	O

the	O
fallacious	O
scheme	O
of	O
quotas	O

requisitions	,
as	O
equally	O
impracticable	O

unjust	.
the	O
result	O
from	O

this	O
is	O
that	O

that	O

that	O
the	O

the	O

difficulty	O
itself	,

is	O
the	O

exceptions	O

with	O
the	O
idea	O

<bos>	O
in	O
the	O
lycian	O
confederacy	,
which	O
consisted	O
of	O
twenty-three	O

appointment	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
judges	O

magistrates	O
of	O
the	O
respective	O
cities	.
this	O
was	O
certainly	O
the	O
most	,
delicate	O
species	O
of	O
interference	O
in	O
their	O
internal	O
administration	;
for	O
if	O
there	O
be	O
any	O
thing	O
that	O
seems	O
exclusively	O
appropriated	O
to	O
the	O
local	O
jurisdictions	,
it	O
is	O
the	O
appointment	O
of	O
their	O
own	O

yet	O
montesquieu	,
speaking	O
of	O
this	O

says	:
``	O
were	O

to	O

a	O
model	O
of	O

''	O
thus	O
we	O
perceive	O
that	O
the	O
distinctions	O

we	O
shall	O

this	O
has	O
relation	O
to	O
two	O
objects	:
to	O
the	O
personal	O
firmness	O
of	O
the	O
executive	O
magistrate	,
in	O
the	O
employment	O
of	O
his	O

to	O
the	O
stability	O
of	O
the	O
system	O
of	O
administration	O
which	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
adopted	O
under	O
his	O
auspices	.
with	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
first	,
it	O
must	O
be	O
evident	,
that	O
the	O
longer	O
the	O
duration	O
in	O
office	,
the	O
greater	O
will	O
be	O
the	O
probability	O
of	O
obtaining	O
so	O
important	O
an	O
advantage	.
it	O
is	O
a	O
general	O
principle	O
of	O
human	O
nature	,
that	O
a	O
man	O
will	O
be	O
interested	O
in	O
whatever	O
he	O

to	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
tenure	O

by	O
a	O
momentary	O

what	O

by	O
a	O
durable	O

of	O
course	,
will	O
be	O
willing	O
to	O

more	O

of	O
the	O
one	,

for	O

this	O

not	O
less	O
applicable	O

political	O
privilege	,

honor	,

trust	,
than	O
to	O
any	O
article	O
of	O

the	O
inference	O
from	O

is	,
that	O
a	O
man	O
acting	O
in	O
the	O
capacity	O
of	O
chief	O
magistrate	,
under	O
a	O
consciousness	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
short	O
time	O
he	O
must	O
lay	O
down	O
his	O
office	,
will	O
be	O
apt	O
to	O
feel	O
himself	O
too	O
little	O
interested	O
in	O
it	O
to	O
hazard	O
any	O
material	O
censure	O

perplexity	,
from	O
the	O
independent	O
exertion	O
of	O

from	O
encountering	O
the	O
ill-humors	,
however	O
transient	,
which	O
may	O
happen	O
to	O
prevail	,
either	O
in	O
a	O
considerable	O

itself	,

in	O
a	O
predominant	O
faction	O
in	O
the	O
legislative	O
body	.
if	O
the	O
case	O
should	O
only	O
be	,
that	O
he	O
might	O
lay	O
it	O
down	,
unless	O
continued	O
by	O
a	O
new	O
choice	,

if	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
desirous	O
of	O
being	O
continued	,
his	O
wishes	,

with	O
his	O
fears	,
would	O
tend	O
still	O
more	O
powerfully	O
to	O
corrupt	O

debase	O
his	O
fortitude	.
in	O
either	O
case	,
feebleness	O

must	O
be	O
the	O
characteristics	O
of	O

the	O

is	O
that	O
they	O
so	O

err	O
as	O
they	O

beset	,
as	O
they	O
continually	O

by	O
the	O

instances	O
might	O
be	O

in	O
which	O
a	O
conduct	O
of	O

has	O
saved	O
the	O
people	O
from	O
very	O
fatal	O
consequences	O
of	O
their	O

has	O
procured	O

monuments	O

however	O
inclined	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
to	O
insist	O
upon	O
an	O
unbounded	O
complaisance	O
in	O
the	O
executive	O
to	O
the	O
inclinations	O
of	O
the	O

we	O
can	O
with	O
no	O
propriety	O
contend	O
for	O
a	O
like	O
complaisance	O
to	O
the	O
humors	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	.
the	O
latter	O
may	O
sometimes	O
stand	O
in	O
opposition	O
to	O
the	O
former	,
and	O
at	O
other	O
times	O
the	O
people	O
may	O
be	O
entirely	O
neutral	.
in	O
either	O
supposition	,
it	O
is	O
certainly	O
desirable	O
that	O
the	O
executive	O
should	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
situation	O
to	O
dare	O
to	O
act	O
his	O
own	O
opinion	O
with	O
vigor	O
and	O
decision	.

<bos>	O
the	O
same	O
rule	O
which	O
teaches	O
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
a	O
partition	O
between	O
the	O
various	O
branches	O
of	O
power	,
teaches	O
us	O
likewise	O
that	O
this	O
partition	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
contrived	O
as	O
to	O
render	O
the	O
one	O
independent	O
of	O
the	O
other	.
to	O
what	O
purpose	O
separate	O
the	O
executive	O
or	O
the	O
judiciary	O
from	O
the	O
legislative	,
if	O
both	O
the	O

are	O
so	O
constituted	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
the	O
absolute	O
devotion	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	?
such	O
a	O
separation	O
must	O
be	O
merely	O
nominal	,
and	O
incapable	O
of	O
producing	O
the	O

may	O
be	O
the	O

of	O

in	O

the	O
tendency	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
authority	O
to	O
absorb	O
every	O
other	,
has	O
been	O
fully	O
displayed	O
and	O
illustrated	O
by	O
examples	O
in	O
some	O
preceding	O
numbers	.
in	O
governments	O
purely	O
republican	,
this	O
tendency	O
is	O
almost	O
irresistible	.
the	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
in	O
a	O
popular	O
assembly	,
seem	O
sometimes	O
to	O
fancy	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
the	O
people	O
themselves	,
and	O
betray	O
strong	O
symptoms	O
of	O
impatience	O
and	O
disgust	O
at	O
the	O
least	O
sign	O
of	O
opposition	O
from	O
any	O

quarter	;
as	O
if	O
the	O
exercise	O
of	O
its	O
rights	,
by	O
either	O
the	O
executive	O
or	O
judiciary	,
were	O
a	O
breach	O
of	O
their	O
privilege	O
and	O
an	O
outrage	O
to	O
their	O
dignity	.
they	O
often	O
appear	O
disposed	O
to	O
exert	O
an	O
imperious	O
control	O
over	O
the	O
other	O
departments	;
and	O
as	O
they	O
commonly	O
have	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
their	O
side	,
they	O
always	O
act	O
with	O
such	O
momentum	O
as	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
very	O
difficult	O
for	O
the	O
other	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
to	O
maintain	O
the	O
balance	O

<bos>	O
it	O
may	O
perhaps	O
be	O
asked	,
how	O
the	O
shortness	O
of	O
the	O
duration	O
in	O
office	O
can	O
affect	O
the	O
independence	O
of	O
the	O
executive	O
on	O
the	O
legislature	,
unless	O
the	O
one	O
were	O
possessed	O
of	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
appointing	O
or	O
displacing	O
the	O
other	.
one	O
answer	O
to	O
this	O
inquiry	O
may	O
be	O
drawn	O
from	O
the	O
principle	O
already	O
remarked	O
that	O
is	,
from	O
the	O
slender	O
interest	O
a	O
man	O
is	O
apt	O
to	O
take	O
in	O
a	O
short-lived	O
advantage	,
and	O
the	O
little	O
inducement	O
it	O
affords	O
him	O
to	O
expose	O
himself	,
on	O
account	O
of	O
it	,
to	O
any	O
considerable	O
inconvenience	O
or	O
hazard	.
another	O
answer	,
perhaps	O
more	O
obvious	,
though	O
not	O
more	O
conclusive	,
will	O
result	O
from	O
the	O
consideration	O
of	O
the	O
influence	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
body	O
over	O
the	O
people	;
which	O
might	O
be	O
employed	O
to	O
prevent	O
the	O
re-election	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
who	,
by	O
an	O
upright	O
resistance	O
to	O
any	O
sinister	O
project	O
of	O
that	O
body	,
should	O
have	O
made	O
himself	O
obnoxious	O
to	O
its	O
resentment	.

<bos>	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
asked	O
also	,
whether	O
a	O
duration	O
of	O
four	O
years	O
would	O
answer	O
the	O
end	O
proposed	;
and	O
if	O
it	O
would	O
not	,
whether	O
a	O
less	O
period	,
which	O
would	O
at	O
least	O
be	O
recommended	O
by	O
greater	O
security	O
against	O
ambitious	O
designs	,
would	O
not	,
for	O
that	O
reason	,
be	O
preferable	O
to	O
a	O
longer	O
period	,
which	O
was	,
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	,
too	O
short	O
for	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
inspiring	O
the	O
desired	O
firmness	O
and	O
independence	O
of	O
the	O
magistrate	.

<bos>	O
it	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
affirmed	,
that	O
a	O
duration	O
of	O
four	O
years	,
or	O
any	O
other	O
limited	O
duration	,
would	O
completely	O
answer	O
the	O
end	O
proposed	;
but	O
it	O
would	O
contribute	O
towards	O
it	O
in	O
a	O
degree	O
which	O
would	O
have	O
a	O
material	O
influence	O
upon	O
the	O
spirit	O
and	O
character	O
of	O
the	O
government	.
between	O
the	O
commencement	O
and	O
termination	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
period	,
there	O
would	O
always	O
be	O
a	O
considerable	O
interval	,
in	O
which	O
the	O
prospect	O
of	O
annihilation	O
would	O
be	O
sufficiently	O
remote	,
not	O
to	O
have	O
an	O
improper	O
effect	O
upon	O
the	O
conduct	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
indued	O
with	O
a	O
tolerable	O
portion	O
of	O
fortitude	;
and	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
might	O
reasonably	O
promise	O
himself	,
that	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
time	O
enough	O
before	O
it	O
arrived	,
to	O
make	O
the	O
community	O
sensible	O
of	O
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
the	O
measures	O
he	O
might	O
incline	O
to	O
pursue	.
though	O
it	O
be	O
probable	O
that	,
as	O
he	O
approached	O
the	O
moment	O
when	O
the	O
public	O
were	,
by	O
a	O
new	O
election	,
to	O
signify	O
their	O
sense	O
of	O
his	O
conduct	,
his	O
confidence	,
and	O
with	O
it	O
his	O
firmness	,
would	O
decline	;
yet	O
both	O
the	O
one	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
would	O
derive	O
support	O
from	O
the	O
opportunities	O
which	O
his	O
previous	O
continuance	O
in	O
the	O
station	O
had	O
afforded	O
him	,
of	O
establishing	O
himself	O
in	O
the	O
esteem	O
and	O
good-will	O
of	O
his	O
constituents	.
he	O
might	,
then	,
hazard	O
with	O
safety	,
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
the	O
proofs	O
he	O
had	O
given	O
of	O
his	O
wisdom	O
and	O
integrity	,
and	O
to	O
the	O
title	O
he	O
had	O
acquired	O
to	O
the	O
respect	O
and	O
attachment	O
of	O
his	O
fellow-citizens	.
as	,
on	O
the	O
one	O
hand	,
a	O
duration	O
of	O
four	O
years	O
will	O
contribute	O
to	O
the	O
firmness	O
of	O
the	O
executive	O
in	O
a	O
sufficient	O
degree	O
to	O
render	O
it	O
a	O
very	O
valuable	O
ingredient	O
in	O
the	O
composition	;
so	,
on	O
the	O
other	,
it	O
is	O
not	O
enough	O
to	O
justify	O
any	O
alarm	O
for	O
the	O
public	O
liberty	.
if	O

that	O

might	O

unequal	O
to	O
the	O

which	O
the	O

i	O
shall	O
only	O

that	O
if	O
his	O

such	O
as	O
to	O
leave	O
a	O
doubt	O
of	O

<bos>	O
before	O
we	O
proceed	O
to	O
examine	O
any	O
other	O
objections	O
to	O
an	O
indefinite	O
power	O
of	O
taxation	O
in	O
the	O
union	,
i	O
shall	O
make	O
one	O
general	O
remark	;
which	O
is	,
that	O
if	O
the	O
jurisdiction	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
government	,
in	O
the	O
article	O
of	O
revenue	,
should	O
be	O
restricted	O
to	O
particular	O
objects	,
it	O
would	O
naturally	O
occasion	O
an	O
undue	O
proportion	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
burdens	O
to	O
fall	O
upon	O
those	O
objects	.
two	O
evils	O
would	O
spring	O
from	O
this	O
source	:
the	O
oppression	O
of	O
particular	O
branches	O
of	O
industry	;
and	O
an	O
unequal	O
distribution	O
of	O
the	O
taxes	,
as	O
well	O
among	O
the	O
several	O
states	O
as	O
among	O
the	O
citizens	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
state	.

<bos>	O
suppose	,
as	O
has	O
been	O
contended	O
for	,
the	O
federal	O
power	O
of	O
taxation	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
confined	O
to	O
duties	O
on	O
imports	,
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
the	O
government	,
for	O
want	O
of	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
command	O
other	O
resources	,
would	O
frequently	O
be	O
tempted	O
to	O
extend	O
these	O
duties	O
to	O
an	O
injurious	O
excess	.
there	O
are	O
persons	O
who	O
imagine	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
never	O
be	O
carried	O
to	O
too	O
great	O
a	O
length	;
since	O
the	O
higher	O
they	O
are	,
the	O
more	O
it	O
is	O
alleged	O
they	O
will	O
tend	O
to	O
discourage	O
an	O
extravagant	O
consumption	,
to	O
produce	O
a	O
favorable	O
balance	O
of	O
trade	,
and	O
to	O
promote	O
domestic	O
manufactures	.
but	O
all	O
extremes	O
are	O
pernicious	O
in	O
various	O
ways	.
exorbitant	O
duties	O
on	O
imported	O
articles	O
would	O
beget	O
a	O
general	O
spirit	O
of	O
smuggling	;
which	O
is	O
always	O
prejudicial	O
to	O
the	O
fair	O
trader	,
and	O
eventually	O
to	O
the	O
revenue	O
itself	:
they	O
tend	O
to	O
render	O
other	O
classes	O
of	O
the	O
community	O
tributary	,
in	O
an	O
improper	O
degree	,
to	O
the	O
manufacturing	O
classes	,
to	O
whom	O
they	O
give	O
a	O
premature	O
monopoly	O
of	O
the	O
markets	;
they	O
sometimes	O
force	O
industry	O
out	O
of	O
its	O
more	O
natural	O
channels	O
into	O
others	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
flows	O
with	O
less	O
advantage	;
and	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
place	,
they	O
oppress	O
the	O
merchant	,
who	O
is	O
often	O
obliged	O
to	O
pay	O
them	O
himself	O
without	O
any	O
retribution	O
from	O
the	O
consumer	.
when	O
the	O
demand	O
is	O
equal	O
to	O
the	O
quantity	O
of	O
goods	O
at	O
market	,
the	O
consumer	O
generally	O
pays	O
the	O
duty	;
but	O
when	O
the	O
markets	O
happen	O
to	O
be	O
overstocked	,
a	O
great	O
proportion	O
falls	O
upon	O
the	O
merchant	,
and	O
sometimes	O
not	O
only	O
exhausts	O
his	O
profits	,
but	O
breaks	O
in	O
upon	O
his	O
capital	.
i	O
am	O
apt	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
a	O
division	O
of	O
the	O
duty	,
between	O
the	O
seller	O
and	O
the	O
buyer	,
more	O
often	O
happens	O
than	O
is	O
commonly	O
imagined	.
it	O
is	O
not	O
always	O
possible	O
to	O
raise	O
the	O
price	O
of	O
a	O
commodity	O
in	O
exact	O
proportion	O
to	O
every	O
additional	O
imposition	O
laid	O
upon	O
it	.
the	O
merchant	,
especially	O
in	O
a	O
country	O
of	O
small	O
commercial	O
capital	,
is	O
often	O
under	O
a	O
necessity	O
of	O
keeping	O
prices	O
down	O
in	O
order	O
to	O

that	O
the	O

that	O
this	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
case	,
as	O

if	O

us	O
now	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
examination	O
of	O
objections	.

<bos>	O
one	O
which	,
if	O
we	O
may	O
judge	O
from	O
the	O
frequency	O
of	O
its	O
repetition	,
seems	O
most	O
to	O
be	O
relied	O
on	,
is	,
that	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	O
is	O
not	O
sufficiently	O
numerous	O
for	O
the	O
reception	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
different	O
classes	O
of	O
citizens	,
in	O
order	O
to	O
combine	O
the	O
interests	O
and	O
feelings	O
of	O
every	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
community	,
and	O
to	O
produce	O
a	O
due	O
sympathy	O
between	O
the	O
representative	O
body	O
and	O
its	O
constituents	.
this	O
argument	O
presents	O
itself	O
under	O
a	O
very	O
specious	O
and	O
seducing	O
form	;
and	O
is	O
well	O
calculated	O
to	O
lay	O
hold	O
of	O
the	O
prejudices	O
of	O
those	O
to	O
whom	O
it	O
is	O
addressed	.
but	O
when	O
we	O
come	O
to	O
dissect	O
it	O
with	O
attention	,
it	O
will	O
appear	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
up	O
of	O
nothing	O
but	O
fair-sounding	O
words	.
the	O
object	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
aim	O
at	O
is	,
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	,
impracticable	,
and	O
in	O
the	O
sense	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
contended	O
for	,
is	O
unnecessary	.
i	O
reserve	O
for	O
another	O
place	O
the	O
discussion	O
of	O
the	O
question	O
which	O
relates	O
to	O
the	O
sufficiency	O
of	O
the	O
representative	O
body	O
in	O
respect	O
to	O
numbers	,
and	O
shall	O
content	O
myself	O
with	O
examining	O
here	O
the	O
particular	O
use	O
which	O
has	O

of	O
a	O
contrary	O
supposition	,

all	O

with	O

to	O

votes	O
to	O
merchants	,
in	O
preference	O
to	O
persons	O
of	O
their	O

those	O
discerning	O
citizens	O
are	O
well	O
aware	O
that	O
the	O
mechanic	O
and	O
manufacturing	O
arts	O
furnish	O
the	O
materials	O
of	O

enterprise	O
and	O
industry	.
many	O
of	O
them	,
indeed	,
are	O
immediately	O
connected	O
with	O
the	O
operations	O
of	O
commerce	.
they	O
know	O
that	O
the	O
merchant	O
is	O
their	O

and	O
they	O
are	O

confidence	O
they	O
may	O
justly	O
feel	O
in	O
their	O

good	O
sense	,
their	O
interests	O
can	O
be	O
more	O
effectually	O
promoted	O
by	O
the	O
merchant	O
than	O
by	O
themselves	.
they	O
are	O
sensible	O
that	O
their	O
habits	O
in	O
life	O
have	O
not	O

to	O

which	,
in	O
a	O
deliberative	O
assembly	,
the	O

abilities	O
are	O
for	O
the	O

useless	;
and	O
that	O
the	O
influence	O
and	O
weight	,
and	O
superior	O
acquirements	O
of	O
the	O
merchants	O
render	O
them	O
more	O
equal	O
to	O
a	O
contest	O
with	O
any	O
spirit	O
which	O
might	O

to	O

itself	O
into	O
the	O
public	O

to	O

these	O
considerations	,
and	O
many	O
others	O
that	O
might	O
be	O
mentioned	O
prove	,
and	O
experience	O
confirms	O
it	,
that	O
artisans	O

manufacturers	O
will	O
commonly	O
be	O
disposed	O
to	O
bestow	O
their	O
votes	O
upon	O
merchants	O
and	O
those	O
whom	O
they	O
recommend	.
we	O
must	O
therefore	O
consider	O
merchants	O
as	O
the	O
natural	O
representatives	O
of	O
all	O
these	O
classes	O
of	O
the	O
community	.

<bos>	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
learned	O
professions	,
little	O
need	O
be	O
observed	;
they	O
truly	O
form	O
no	O
distinct	O
interest	O
in	O
society	,
and	O
according	O
to	O
their	O
situation	O
and	O
talents	,
will	O
be	O
indiscriminately	O
the	O
objects	O
of	O
the	O
confidence	O
and	O
choice	O
of	O
each	O
other	,
and	O
of	O
other	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O

<bos>	O
nothing	O
remains	O
but	O
the	O
landed	O
interest	;
and	O
this	,
in	O
a	O
political	O
view	,
and	O
particularly	O
in	O

taxes	,
i	O

perfectly	O

from	O
the	O

down	O
to	O
the	O

no	O
tax	O
can	O
be	O
laid	O
on	O
land	O
which	O
will	O
not	O
affect	O
the	O
proprietor	O
of	O
millions	O
of	O
acres	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
proprietor	O
of	O
a	O
single	O

every	O
landholder	O
will	O
therefore	O
have	O
a	O
common	O
interest	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
taxes	O
on	O
land	O
as	O
low	O
as	O
possible	;
and	O
common	O
interest	O
may	O
always	O
be	O
reckoned	O
upon	O
as	O
the	O
surest	O
bond	O
of	O
sympathy	.
but	O
if	O
we	O
even	O
could	O
suppose	O
a	O
distinction	O
of	O
interest	O
between	O
the	O
opulent	O
landholder	O
and	O
the	O
middling	O
farmer	,
what	O
reason	O
is	O
there	O
to	O
conclude	,
that	O
the	O
first	O
would	O
stand	O
a	O
better	O
chance	O
of	O
being	O
deputed	O
to	O
the	O
national	O
legislature	O
than	O
the	O
last	?
if	O
we	O
take	O
fact	O
as	O
our	O
guide	,
and	O
look	O
into	O
our	O
own	O
senate	O
and	O
assembly	,
we	O
shall	O
find	O
that	O
moderate	O
proprietors	O
of	O
land	O
prevail	O
in	O
both	;
nor	O
is	O
this	O
less	O
the	O
case	O
in	O
the	O
senate	,
which	O

in	O

the	O

to	O
choose	O
a	O
small	O

their	O

will	O
fall	O
upon	O
those	O
in	O
whom	O
they	O
have	O

confidence	;
whether	O
these	O
happen	O
to	O

men	O
of	O
large	O

or	O
of	O

of	O
no	O

at	O

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
necessary	,
that	O
all	O

the	O

the	O

be	O
made	O
an	O

to	O

is	O
it	O
not	O

that	O
men	O
who	O
declare	O
an	O
attachment	O
to	O

in	O

should	O
urge	O
as	O
an	O
objection	O
to	O
the	O

what	O
applies	O
with	O
tenfold	O
weight	O
to	O

what	,

as	O
it	O
has	O
any	O
foundation	O
in	O

is	O
an	O

of	O
one	O

system	,
two	,

three	,

even	O
four	O
confederacies	O

the	O

oppose	O
itself	O
to	O
the	O

the	O

when	O
these	O

to	O

recourse	O
to	O
the	O

expedients	O
for	O

its	O
authority	O
which	O
are	O
objected	O
to	O
in	O
a	O

for	O

to	O
support	O
the	O

in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O

all	O
candid	O

men	O
must	,
upon	O
due	O
consideration	,
acknowledge	O
that	O
the	O
principle	O
of	O
the	O
objection	O
is	O
equally	O
applicable	O
to	O

the	O
two	O

there	O
should	O
be	O
an	O

there	O
might	O
sometimes	O
be	O
a	O
necessity	O
to	O

use	O
of	O
a	O

constituted	O
differently	O
from	O
the	O

to	O
preserve	O
the	O

<bos>	O
the	O
mode	O
of	O
appointment	O
of	O
the	O
chief	O
magistrate	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
is	O
almost	O
the	O
only	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
system	,
of	O
any	O
consequence	,
which	O
has	O
escaped	O
without	O
severe	O
censure	,
or	O
which	O
has	O
received	O
the	O
slightest	O
mark	O
of	O
approbation	O
from	O
its	O
opponents	.
the	O
most	O
plausible	O
of	O
these	,
who	O
has	O
appeared	O
in	O
print	,
has	O
even	O
deigned	O
to	O
admit	O
that	O
the	O
election	O
of	O
the	O
president	O
is	O
pretty	O
well	O
guarded.1	O
i	O
venture	O
somewhat	O
further	,
and	O
hesitate	O
not	O
to	O
affirm	,
that	O
if	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
it	O
be	O
not	O
perfect	,
it	O
is	O
at	O
least	O
excellent	.
it	O
unites	O
in	O
an	O
eminent	O
degree	O
all	O
the	O
advantages	,
the	O
union	O
of	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
wished	O
for	.

<bos>	O
it	O
was	O
desirable	O
that	O
the	O
sense	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
should	O
operate	O
in	O
the	O
choice	O
of	O
the	O
person	O
to	O
whom	O
so	O
important	O
a	O
trust	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
confided	.
this	O
end	O
will	O
be	O
answered	O
by	O
committing	O
the	O
right	O
of	O
making	O
it	,
not	O
to	O
any	O
preestablished	O
body	,
but	O
to	O
men	O
chosen	O
by	O
the	O
people	O
for	O
the	O
special	O
purpose	,
and	O
at	O
the	O
particular	O
conjuncture	.

<bos>	O
it	O
was	O
equally	O
desirable	,
that	O
the	O
immediate	O
election	O
should	O
be	O
made	O
by	O
men	O
most	O
capable	O
of	O
analyzing	O
the	O
qualities	O
adapted	O
to	O
the	O
station	,
and	O
acting	O
under	O
circumstances	O
favorable	O
to	O
deliberation	,
and	O
to	O
a	O
judicious	O
combination	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
reasons	O
and	O
inducements	O
which	O
were	O
proper	O
to	O
govern	O
their	O
choice	.
a	O
small	O
number	O
of	O
persons	,
selected	O
by	O
their	O
fellow-citizens	O
from	O
the	O
general	O
mass	,
will	O
be	O
most	O
likely	O
to	O
possess	O
the	O
information	O
and	O
discernment	O
requisite	O
to	O
such	O
complicated	O
investigations	.

<bos>	O
it	O
was	O
also	O
peculiarly	O
desirable	O
to	O
afford	O
as	O
little	O
opportunity	O
as	O
possible	O
to	O
tumult	O
and	O
disorder	.
this	O
evil	O
was	O
not	O
least	O
to	O
be	O
dreaded	O
in	O
the	O
election	O
of	O
a	O
magistrate	,
who	O
was	O
to	O
have	O
so	O
important	O
an	O
agency	O
in	O
the	O
administration	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
as	O
the	O
president	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	.
but	O
the	O
precautions	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
so	O
happily	O
concerted	O
in	O
the	O
system	O
under	O
consideration	,
promise	O
an	O
effectual	O
security	O
against	O
this	O
mischief	.
the	O
choice	O
of	O
several	,
to	O
form	O
an	O
intermediate	O
body	O
of	O
electors	,
will	O
be	O
much	O
less	O
apt	O
to	O
convulse	O
the	O
community	O
with	O
any	O
extraordinary	O
or	O
violent	O
movements	,
than	O
the	O
choice	O
of	O
one	O
who	O
was	O
himself	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
final	O
object	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
wishes	.
and	O
as	O
the	O
electors	,
chosen	O
in	O
each	O
state	,
are	O
to	O
assemble	O
and	O
vote	O
in	O
the	O
state	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
chosen	,
this	O
detached	O
and	O
divided	O
situation	O
will	O
expose	O
them	O
much	O
less	O
to	O
heats	O
and	O
ferments	,
which	O
might	O
be	O
communicated	O
from	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
people	,
than	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
to	O
be	O
convened	O
at	O
one	O
time	,
in	O
one	O
place	.

<bos>	O
nothing	O
was	O
more	O
to	O
be	O
desired	O
than	O
that	O
every	O
practicable	O
obstacle	O
should	O
be	O
opposed	O
to	O
cabal	,
intrigue	,
and	O
corruption	.
these	O
most	O
deadly	O
adversaries	O
of	O
republican	O
government	O
might	O
naturally	O
have	O
been	O
expected	O
to	O
make	O
their	O
approaches	O
from	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
querter	,
but	O
chiefly	O
from	O
the	O
desire	O
in	O
foreign	O
powers	O
to	O
gain	O
an	O
improper	O
ascendant	O
in	O
our	O
councils	.
how	O
could	O
they	O
better	O
gratify	O
this	,
than	O
by	O
raising	O
a	O
creature	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
to	O
the	O
chief	O
magistracy	O
of	O
the	O
union	?
but	O
the	O
convention	O
have	O
guarded	O
against	O
all	O
danger	O
of	O
this	O
sort	,
with	O
the	O
most	O
provident	O
and	O
judicious	O
attention	.
they	O
have	O
not	O
made	O
the	O
appointment	O
of	O
the	O
president	O
to	O
depend	O
on	O
any	O
preexisting	O
bodies	O
of	O
men	,
who	O
might	O
be	O
tampered	O
with	O
beforehand	O
to	O
prostitute	O
their	O
votes	;
but	O
they	O
have	O
referred	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
instance	O
to	O
an	O
immediate	O
act	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
america	,
to	O
be	O
exerted	O
in	O
the	O
choice	O
of	O
persons	O
for	O
the	O
temporary	O
and	O
sole	O
purpose	O
of	O
making	O
the	O
appointment	.
and	O
they	O
have	O
excluded	O
from	O
eligibility	O
to	O
this	O
trust	,
all	O
those	O
who	O
from	O
situation	O
might	O
be	O
suspected	O
of	O
too	O
great	O
devotion	O
to	O
the	O
president	O
in	O
office	.
no	O

under	O

thus	O
without	O
corrupting	O
the	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
the	O
immediate	O
agents	O
in	O
the	O

at	O

enter	O
upon	O
the	O
task	O
free	O
from	O

bias	.
their	O
transient	O
existence	,
and	O
their	O
detached	O
situation	,
already	O
taken	O
notice	O
of	,
afford	O
a	O
satisfactory	O
prospect	O
of	O
their	O
continuing	O
so	,
to	O
the	O
conclusion	O
of	O
it	.
the	O
business	O
of	O
corruption	,
when	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
embrace	O
so	O
considerable	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
men	,
requires	O
time	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
means	.
nor	O
would	O
it	O
be	O
found	O
easy	O
suddenly	O
to	O
embark	O
them	,
dispersed	O
as	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
over	O
thirteen	O
states	,
in	O
any	O
combinations	O
founded	O
upon	O
motives	,
which	O
though	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
properly	O
be	O
denominated	O
corrupt	,
might	O
yet	O
be	O
of	O
a	O
nature	O
to	O
mislead	O
them	O
from	O
their	O
duty	.

<bos>	O
another	O
and	O
no	O
less	O
important	O
desideratum	O
was	,
that	O
the	O
executive	O
should	O
be	O
independent	O
for	O
his	O
continuance	O
in	O
office	O
on	O
all	O
but	O
the	O
people	O
themselves	.
he	O
might	O
otherwise	O
be	O
tempted	O
to	O
sacrifice	O
his	O
duty	O
to	O
his	O
complaisance	O
for	O
those	O
whose	O
favor	O
was	O
necessary	O
to	O
the	O
duration	O
of	O
his	O
official	O
consequence	.
this	O
advantage	O
will	O
also	O
be	O
secured	,
by	O
making	O
his	O
re-election	O
to	O
depend	O
on	O
a	O
special	O
body	O
of	O
representatives	,
deputed	O
by	O
the	O
society	O
for	O
the	O
single	O
purpose	O
of	O
making	O
the	O
important	O
choice	.

<bos>	O
all	O
these	O
advantages	O
will	O
happily	O
combine	O
in	O
the	O
plan	O
devised	O
by	O
the	O
convention	;
which	O
is	,
that	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
each	O
state	O
shall	O
choose	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
persons	O
as	O
electors	,
equal	O
to	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
senators	O
and	O
representatives	O
of	O
such	O
state	O
in	O
the	O
national	O
government	,
who	O
shall	O
assemble	O
within	O
the	O
state	,
and	O
vote	O
for	O
some	O
fit	O
person	O
as	O
president	.
their	O
votes	,
thus	O
given	,
are	O
to	O
be	O
transmitted	O
to	O
the	O
seat	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
government	,
and	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
may	O
happen	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
number	O
of	O
votes	O
will	O
be	O
the	O
president	.
but	O
as	O
a	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
votes	O
might	O
not	O
always	O
happen	O
to	O
centre	O
in	O
one	O
man	,
and	O
as	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
unsafe	O
to	O
permit	O
less	O
than	O
a	O
majority	O
to	O
be	O
conclusive	,
it	O
is	O
provided	O
that	,
in	O
such	O
a	O
contingency	,
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	O
shall	O
select	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
candidates	O
who	O
shall	O
have	O
the	O
five	O

number	O
of	O

the	O
man	O
who	O
in	O
their	O
opinion	O
may	O
be	O
best	O
qualified	O
for	O
the	O
office	.

<bos>	O
the	O
process	O
of	O
election	O
affords	O
a	O
moral	O
certainty	,
that	O
the	O
office	O
of	O
president	O
will	O
never	O
fall	O
to	O
the	O
lot	O
of	O
any	O
man	O
who	O
is	O
not	O
in	O
an	O
eminent	O

endowed	O
with	O
the	O
requisite	O
qualifications	.
talents	O
for	O
low	O
intrigue	,
and	O
the	O
little	O
arts	O
of	O
popularity	,
may	O
alone	O
suffice	O
to	O
elevate	O
a	O
man	O
to	O
the	O
first	O
honors	O
in	O
a	O
single	O
state	;
but	O
it	O
will	O
require	O
other	O
talents	,
and	O
a	O
different	O
kind	O
of	O
merit	,
to	O
establish	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
esteem	O
and	O
confidence	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
union	,
or	O
of	O
so	O
considerable	O
a	O
portion	O
of	O
it	O
as	O
would	O
be	O
necessary	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
a	O
successful	O
candidate	O
for	O
the	O
distinguished	O
office	O
of	O
president	O
of	O
the	O
united	O

it	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
too	O
strong	O
to	O
say	,
that	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
a	O
constant	O
probability	O
of	O
seeing	O
the	O
station	O
filled	O
by	O
characters	O
pre-eminent	O
for	O
ability	O
and	O
virtue	.
and	O
this	O
will	O
be	O
thought	O
no	O
inconsiderable	O
recommendation	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	,
by	O
those	O
who	O
are	O
able	O
to	O
estimate	O
the	O
share	O
which	O
the	O
executive	O
in	O
every	O
government	O
must	O
necessarily	O
have	O
in	O
its	O
good	O
or	O
ill	O
administration	.
though	O
we	O
can	O
not	O
acquiesce	O
in	O
the	O
political	O
heresy	O
of	O
the	O
poet	O
who	O
says	:
``	O
for	O
forms	O
of	O
government	O
let	O
fools	O
contest	O
that	O
which	O
is	O
best	O
administered	O
is	O
best	,
''	O
yet	O
we	O
may	O
safely	O
pronounce	,
that	O
the	O
true	O
test	O
of	O
a	O
good	O
government	O
is	O
its	O
aptitude	O
and	O
tendency	O
to	O
produce	O
a	O
good	O
administration	.

<bos>	O
the	O
vice-president	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
chosen	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
with	O
the	O
president	;
with	O
this	O
difference	,
that	O
the	O
senate	O
is	O
to	O
do	,
in	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
former	,
what	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
by	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	,
in	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
latter	.

<bos>	O
the	O
appointment	O
of	O
an	O
extraordinary	O
person	,
as	O
vice-president	,
has	O
been	O
objected	O
to	O
as	O
superfluous	,
if	O
not	O
mischievous	.
it	O
has	O
been	O
alleged	,
that	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
preferable	O
to	O
have	O
authorized	O
the	O
senate	O
to	O
elect	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
body	O
an	O
officer	O
answering	O
that	O
description	.
but	O
two	O
considerations	O
seem	O
to	O
justify	O
the	O
ideas	O
of	O
the	O
convention	O
in	O
this	O
respect	.
one	O
is	,
that	O
to	O
secure	O
at	O
all	O
times	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
a	O
definite	O
resolution	O
of	O
the	O
body	,
it	O
is	O
necessary	O
that	O
the	O
president	O
should	O
have	O
only	O
a	O
casting	O
vote	.
and	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
senator	O
of	O
any	O
state	O
from	O
his	O
seat	O
as	O
senator	,
to	O
place	O
him	O
in	O
that	O
of	O
president	O
of	O
the	O
senate	,
would	O
be	O
to	O
exchange	,
in	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
state	O
from	O
which	O
he	O
came	,
a	O
constant	O
for	O
a	O
contingent	O
vote	.
the	O
other	O
consideration	O
is	,
that	O
as	O
the	O
vice-president	O
may	O
occasionally	O
become	O
a	O

in	O
this	,

in	O
most	O

instances	,
the	O
objection	O
which	O
is	O
made	O
would	O
lie	O
against	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
this	O

we	O
have	O
a	O
lieutenant-governor	,

by	O

who	O
presides	O
in	O

is	O
the	O
constitutional	O
substitute	O
for	O
the	O

which	O

in	O

to	O

creation	O

direction	O
of	O
the	O

i	O
have	O
met	O
with	O
but	O
one	O
specific	O
objection	,
which	,
if	O
i	O
understand	O
it	O
right	,
is	O
this	,
that	O
proper	O
provision	O
has	O
not	O
been	O
made	O
against	O
the	O
existence	O
of	O
standing	O
armies	O
in	O
time	O
of	O

an	O
objection	O
which	,
i	O
shall	O
now	O
endeavor	O
to	O
show	,
rests	O
on	O
weak	O
and	O
unsubstantial	O
foundations	.

<bos>	O
it	O
has	O
indeed	O
been	O
brought	O
forward	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
vague	O
and	O
general	O
form	,
supported	O
only	O
by	O
bold	O
assertions	,
without	O

without	O

the	O
proprietory	O
of	O
this	O
remark	O
will	O
appear	,
the	O
moment	O
it	O
is	O
recollected	O
that	O
the	O
objection	O
under	O
consideration	O
turns	O
upon	O
a	O
supposed	O
necessity	O
of	O
restraining	O
the	O
legislative	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
nation	,
in	O
the	O
article	O
of	O
military	O
establishments	;
a	O
principle	O
unheard	O
of	,
except	O
in	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
state	O
constitutions	,
and	O
rejected	O
in	O

rest	.

<bos>	O
a	O
stranger	O
to	O
our	O
politics	,
who	O
was	O
to	O
read	O
our	O
newspapers	O
at	O
the	O
present	O
juncture	,
without	O
having	O
previously	O
inspected	O
the	O
plan	O
reported	O
by	O
the	O
convention	,
would	O
be	O
naturally	O
led	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
two	O
conclusions	:
either	O
that	O
it	O
contained	O
a	O
positive	O
injunction	,
that	O
standing	O
armies	O
should	O
be	O
kept	O
up	O
in	O
time	O
of	O
peace	;
or	O
that	O
it	O
vested	O
in	O
the	O
executive	O
the	O
whole	O
power	O
of	O
levying	O
troops	,
without	O
subjecting	O
his	O
discretion	,
in	O
any	O
shape	,
to	O
the	O
control	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	.

<bos>	O
if	O
he	O
came	O
afterwards	O
to	O
peruse	O
the	O
plan	O
itself	,
he	O
would	O
be	O
surprised	O
to	O
discover	,
that	O
neither	O
the	O
one	O
nor	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
the	O
case	;
that	O
the	O
whole	O
power	O
of	O
raising	O
armies	O
was	O
lodged	O
in	O
the	O
legislature	,
not	O
in	O
the	O
executive	;
that	O
this	O
legislature	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
popular	O
body	,
consisting	O
of	O
the	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
periodically	O
elected	;
and	O
that	O
instead	O
of	O
the	O
provision	O
he	O
had	O
supposed	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
standing	O
armies	,
there	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
found	,
in	O
respect	O
to	O
this	O
object	,
an	O
important	O
qualification	O
even	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
discretion	,
in	O
that	O
clause	O
which	O
forbids	O
the	O
appropriation	O
of	O
money	O
for	O
the	O
support	O
of	O
an	O
army	O
for	O
any	O
longer	O
period	O
than	O
two	O
years	O
a	O
precaution	O
which	,
upon	O
a	O
nearer	O
view	O
of	O
it	,
will	O
appear	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
great	O
and	O
real	O
security	O
against	O
the	O
keeping	O
up	O
of	O
troops	O
without	O
evident	O
necessity	.

<bos>	O
disappointed	O
in	O
his	O
first	O
surmise	,
the	O
person	O
i	O
have	O
supposed	O
would	O
be	O
apt	O
to	O
pursue	O
his	O
conjectures	O
a	O
little	O
further	.
he	O
would	O
naturally	O
say	O
to	O
himself	,
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
that	O
all	O
this	O
vehement	O
and	O
pathetic	O
declamation	O
can	O
be	O
without	O
some	O
colorable	O
pretext	.
it	O
must	O
needs	O
be	O
that	O
this	O
people	,
so	O
jealous	O
of	O
their	O
liberties	,
have	,
in	O
all	O
the	O
preceding	O
models	O
of	O
the	O
constitutions	O
which	O
they	O
have	O
established	,
inserted	O
the	O
most	O
precise	O
and	O
rigid	O
precautions	O
on	O
this	O
point	,
the	O
omission	O
of	O
which	,
in	O
the	O
new	O
plan	,
has	O
given	O
birth	O
to	O
all	O
this	O
apprehension	O
and	O
clamor	.

<bos>	O
if	,
under	O
this	O
impression	,
he	O
proceeded	O
to	O
pass	O
in	O
review	O
the	O
several	O
state	O
constitutions	,
how	O
great	O
would	O
be	O
his	O
disappointment	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
two	O
only	O
of	O
them1	O
contained	O
an	O
interdiction	O
of	O
standing	O
armies	O
in	O
time	O
of	O
peace	;
that	O
the	O
other	O
eleven	O
had	O
either	O
observed	O
a	O
profound	O
silence	O
on	O
the	O
subject	,
or	O
had	O
in	O
express	O
terms	O
admitted	O
the	O
right	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	O
to	O
authorize	O
their	O
existence	.

<bos>	O
still	,
however	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
persuaded	O
that	O
there	O
must	O
be	O
some	O
plausible	O
foundation	O
for	O
the	O
cry	O
raised	O
on	O
this	O
head	.
he	O
would	O
never	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
imagine	,
while	O
any	O
source	O
of	O
information	O
remained	O
unexplored	,
that	O
it	O
was	O
nothing	O
more	O
than	O
an	O
experiment	O
upon	O
the	O
public	O
credulity	,
dictated	O
either	O
by	O
a	O
deliberate	O
intention	O
to	O
deceive	,
or	O
by	O
the	O
overflowings	O
of	O
a	O
zeal	O
too	O
intemperate	O
to	O
be	O
ingenuous	.
it	O
would	O
probably	O
occur	O
to	O
him	,
that	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
likely	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
precautions	O
he	O
was	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
in	O
the	O
primitive	O
compact	O
between	O
the	O
states	.
here	,
at	O
length	,
he	O
would	O
expect	O
to	O
meet	O
with	O
a	O
solution	O
of	O
the	O
enigma	.
no	O
doubt	,
he	O
would	O
observe	O
to	O
himself	,
the	O
existing	O
confederation	O
must	O
contain	O
the	O
most	O
explicit	O
provisions	O
against	O
military	O
establishments	O
in	O
time	O
of	O
peace	;
and	O
a	O
departure	O
from	O
this	O
model	,
in	O
a	O
favorite	O
point	,
has	O
occasioned	O
the	O
discontent	O
which	O
appears	O
to	O
influence	O
these	O
political	O
champions	.

<bos>	O
if	O
he	O
should	O
now	O
apply	O
himself	O
to	O
a	O
careful	O
and	O
critical	O
survey	O
of	O
the	O
articles	O
of	O
confederation	,
his	O
astonishment	O
would	O
not	O
only	O
be	O
increased	,
but	O
would	O
acquire	O
a	O
mixture	O
of	O
indignation	,
at	O
the	O
unexpected	O
discovery	,
that	O
these	O
articles	,
instead	O
of	O
containing	O
the	O
prohibition	O
he	O
looked	O
for	,
and	O
though	O
they	O
had	,
with	O
jealous	O
circumspection	,
restricted	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	O
in	O
this	O
particular	,
had	O
not	O
imposed	O
a	O
single	O
restraint	O
on	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	.
if	O
he	O
happened	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
quick	O
sensibility	,
or	O
ardent	O
temper	,
he	O
could	O
now	O
no	O
longer	O
refrain	O
from	O
regarding	O
these	O
clamors	O
as	O
the	O
dishonest	O
artifices	O
of	O
a	O
sinister	O
and	O
unprincipled	O
opposition	O
to	O
a	O
plan	O
which	O
ought	O
at	O
least	O
to	O
receive	O
a	O
fair	O
and	O
candid	O
examination	O
from	O
all	O
sincere	O
lovers	O
of	O
their	O
country	!
how	O
else	,
he	O
would	O
say	,
could	O
the	O
authors	O
of	O
them	O
have	O
been	O
tempted	O
to	O
vent	O
such	O
loud	O
censures	O
upon	O
that	O
plan	,
about	O
a	O
point	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
have	O
conformed	O
itself	O
to	O
the	O
general	O
sense	O
of	O
america	O
as	O
declared	O
in	O
its	O
different	O
forms	O
of	O
government	,
and	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
has	O
even	O
superadded	O
a	O
new	O
and	O
powerful	O
guard	O
unknown	O
to	O
any	O
of	O
them	?
if	,
on	O
the	O
contrary	,
he	O
happened	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
calm	O
and	O
dispassionate	O
feelings	,
he	O
would	O
indulge	O
a	O
sigh	O
for	O
the	O
frailty	O
of	O
human	O
nature	,
and	O
would	O
lament	,
that	O
in	O
a	O
matter	O
so	O
interesting	O
to	O
the	O
happiness	O
of	O
millions	,
the	O
true	O
merits	O
of	O
the	O
question	O
should	O
be	O
perplexed	O
and	O
entangled	O
by	O
expedients	O
so	O
unfriendly	O
to	O
an	O
impartial	O
and	O
right	O
determination	.
even	O
such	O
a	O
man	O
could	O
hardly	O
forbear	O
remarking	,
that	O
a	O
conduct	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
has	O
too	O
much	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
an	O
intention	O
to	O
mislead	O
the	O
people	O
by	O
alarming	O
their	O
passions	,
rather	O
than	O
to	O
convince	O
them	O
by	O
arguments	O
addressed	O
to	O
their	O
understandings	.

<bos>	O
but	O
however	O
little	O
this	O
objection	O
may	O
be	O
countenanced	,
even	O
by	O
precedents	O
among	O
ourselves	,
it	O
may	O
be	O
satisfactory	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
nearer	O
view	O
of	O
its	O
intrinsic	O
merits	.
from	O
a	O
close	O
examination	O
it	O
will	O
appear	O
that	O
restraints	O
upon	O
the	O
discretion	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	O
in	O
respect	O
to	O
military	O
establishments	O
in	O
time	O
of	O
peace	,
would	O
be	O
improper	O
to	O
be	O
imposed	,
and	O
if	O
imposed	,
from	O
the	O
necessities	O
of	O
society	,
would	O
be	O
unlikely	O
to	O
be	O
observed	.

though	O

wide	O
ocean	O
separates	O
the	O

from	O

yet	O
there	O
are	O

considerations	O

here	O
is	O
a	O
simple	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
subject	,
that	O
shows	O
us	O
at	O
once	O
the	O
impropriety	O
of	O
a	O
constitutional	O
interdiction	O
of	O
such	O
establishments	,
and	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
leaving	O
the	O

the	O
discretion	O
and	O
prudence	O
of	O
the	O

<bos>	O
in	O

to	O
our	O
increase	O
in	O
strength	,
it	O
is	O
probable	,
nay	,
it	O
may	O
be	O
said	O
certain	,
that	O
britain	O
and	O
spain	O
would	O
augment	O
their	O
military	O
establishments	O
in	O
our	O
neighborhood	.
if	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
willing	O
to	O
be	O
exposed	,
in	O
a	O
naked	O
and	O
defenseless	O
condition	,
to	O
their	O
insults	O
and	O
encroachments	,
we	O
should	O
find	O
it	O
expedient	O
to	O
increase	O
our	O
frontier	O
garrisons	O
in	O
some	O
ratio	O
to	O
the	O
force	O
by	O
which	O
our	O
western	O
settlements	O
might	O
be	O

there	O
are	,

the	O

the	O

it	O
may	O
be	O
added	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
those	O

be	O
keys	O
to	O

can	O
any	O

think	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
wise	O
to	O
leave	O
such	O
posts	O
in	O
a	O
situation	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
any	O
instant	O
seized	O
by	O
one	O
or	O
the	O
other	O
of	O
two	O
neighboring	O

formidable	O
powers	?
to	O
act	O
this	O

would	O
be	O
to	O

all	O
the	O

<bos>	O
if	O

a	O
commercial	O
people	,
or	O
even	O
to	O
be	O

on	O

we	O
must	O

as	O

a	O

to	O
this	O
purpose	O
there	O

and	O
for	O
the	O
defense	O
of	O
these	,
fortifications	,
and	O
probably	O
garrisons	.
when	O
a	O
nation	O
has	O

powerful	O
by	O
sea	O
that	O
it	O
can	O
protect	O
its	O
dock-yards	O
by	O
its	O
fleets	,
this	O
supersedes	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
garrisons	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	;
but	O
where	O
naval	O
establishments	O
are	O
in	O
their	O
infancy	,

garrisons	O
will	,
in	O
all	O

be	O
found	O
an	O

against	O

for	O
the	O

of	O

<bos>	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
urged	,
in	O
different	O
shapes	,
that	O
a	O
constitution	O
of	O
the	O
kind	O
proposed	O
by	O
the	O
convention	O
can	O
not	O
operate	O
without	O
the	O
aid	O
of	O
a	O
military	O
force	O
to	O
execute	O
its	O
laws	.
this	,
however	,
like	O
most	O
other	O
things	O
that	O
have	O
been	O
alleged	O
on	O
that	O
side	,
rests	O
on	O
mere	O
general	O
assertion	,
unsupported	O
by	O
any	O
precise	O
or	O
intelligible	O
designation	O
of	O
the	O
reasons	O
upon	O
which	O
it	O
is	O

as	O

as	O
i	O
have	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
divine	O
the	O
latent	O
meaning	O
of	O
the	O
objectors	,
it	O
seems	O
to	O
originate	O
in	O
a	O
presupposition	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
will	O
be	O
disinclined	O
to	O
the	O
exercise	O
of	O
federal	O
authority	O
in	O
any	O

that	O
might	O
be	O

to	O
the	O
inaccuracy	O
or	O
inexplicitness	O
of	O
the	O
distinction	O
between	O
internal	O
and	O
external	,
let	O
us	O
inquire	O
what	O
ground	O
there	O
is	O
to	O
presuppose	O
that	O
disinclination	O
in	O
the	O
people	.
unless	O
we	O
presume	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
that	O
the	O
powers	O
of	O
the	O
general	O
government	O
will	O
be	O
worse	O
administered	O
than	O
those	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
government	,
there	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
no	O
room	O
for	O
the	O
presumption	O
of	O
ill-will	,
disaffection	,
or	O
opposition	O
in	O
the	O
people	.
i	O
believe	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
laid	O
down	O
as	O
a	O
general	O
rule	O
that	O
their	O
confidence	O
in	O
and	O
obedience	O
to	O
a	O
government	O
will	O
commonly	O
be	O
proportioned	O
to	O
the	O
goodness	O
or	O
badness	O
of	O
its	O
administration	.
it	O
must	O
be	O
admitted	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
exceptions	O
to	O
this	O
rule	;
but	O
these	O
exceptions	O
depend	O
so	O
entirely	O
on	O
accidental	O
causes	,
that	O
they	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
having	O
any	O
relation	O
to	O
the	O
intrinsic	O
merits	O
or	O
demerits	O
of	O
a	O
constitution	.
these	O
can	O
only	O
be	O
judged	O
of	O
by	O
general	O
principles	O
and	O
maxims	.

<bos>	O
various	O
reasons	O
have	O
been	O
suggested	,
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
these	O
papers	,
to	O
induce	O
a	O
probability	O
that	O
the	O
general	O
government	O
will	O
be	O
better	O
administered	O
than	O
the	O
particular	O
governments	;
the	O
principal	O
of	O
which	O
reasons	O
are	O
that	O
the	O
extension	O
of	O
the	O
spheres	O
of	O
election	O
will	O
present	O
a	O
greater	O
option	,
or	O
latitude	O
of	O
choice	,
to	O
the	O
people	;
that	O
through	O
the	O
medium	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	O
which	O
are	O
select	O
bodies	O
of	O
men	,
and	O
which	O
are	O
to	O
appoint	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
senate	O
there	O
is	O
reason	O
to	O
expect	O
that	O
this	O
branch	O
will	O
generally	O
be	O
composed	O
with	O
peculiar	O
care	O
and	O
judgment	;
that	O
these	O
circumstances	O
promise	O
greater	O
knowledge	O
and	O
more	O
extensive	O
information	O
in	O
the	O
national	O
councils	,
and	O
that	O
they	O
will	O
be	O
less	O
apt	O
to	O
be	O
tainted	O
by	O
the	O
spirit	O
of	O
faction	,
and	O
more	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
reach	O
of	O
those	O
occasional	O
ill-humors	,
or	O
temporary	O
prejudices	O
and	O
propensities	,
which	,
in	O
smaller	O
societies	,
frequently	O
contaminate	O
the	O
public	O
councils	,
beget	O
injustice	O
and	O
oppression	O
of	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
community	,
and	O
engender	O
schemes	O
which	,
though	O
they	O
gratify	O
a	O
momentary	O
inclination	O
or	O
desire	,
terminate	O
in	O
general	O
distress	,
dissatisfaction	,
and	O
disgust	.
several	O
additional	O
reasons	O
of	O
considerable	O
force	,
to	O
fortify	O
that	O
probability	,
will	O
occur	O
when	O
we	O
come	O
to	O
survey	,
with	O
a	O
more	O
critical	O
eye	,
the	O
interior	O
structure	O
of	O
the	O
edifice	O
which	O
we	O
are	O
invited	O
to	O
erect	.
it	O
will	O
be	O
sufficient	O
here	O
to	O
remark	,
that	O
until	O
satisfactory	O
reasons	O
can	O
be	O
assigned	O
to	O
justify	O
an	O
opinion	,
that	O
the	O
federal	O
government	O
is	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
administered	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
as	O
to	O
render	O
it	O
odious	O
or	O
contemptible	O
to	O
the	O
people	,
there	O
can	O
be	O
no	O
reasonable	O
foundation	O
for	O
the	O
supposition	O
that	O
the	O
laws	O
of	O
the	O
union	O
will	O
meet	O
with	O
any	O
greater	O
obstruction	O
from	O
them	,
or	O
will	O
stand	O
in	O
need	O
of	O
any	O
other	O
methods	O
to	O
enforce	O
their	O
execution	,
than	O
the	O
laws	O
of	O
the	O
particular	O
members	.

<bos>	O
the	O
hope	O
of	O
impunity	O
is	O
a	O
strong	O
incitement	O
to	O
sedition	;
the	O
dread	O
of	O
punishment	,
a	O
proportionably	O
strong	O
discouragement	O
to	O
it	.
will	O
not	O
the	O
government	O
of	O
the	O
union	,
which	,
if	O
possessed	O
of	O
a	O
due	O
degree	O
of	O
power	,
can	O
call	O
to	O
its	O
aid	O
the	O
collective	O
resources	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
confederacy	,
be	O
more	O
likely	O
to	O
repress	O
the	O
former	O
sentiment	O
and	O
to	O
inspire	O
the	O
latter	,
than	O
that	O
of	O
a	O
single	O
state	,
which	O
can	O
only	O
command	O
the	O
resources	O
within	O
itself	?
a	O
turbulent	O
faction	O
in	O
a	O
state	O
may	O
easily	O
suppose	O
itself	O
able	O
to	O
contend	O
with	O
the	O
friends	O
to	O
the	O
government	O
in	O
that	O
state	;
but	O
it	O
can	O
hardly	O
be	O
so	O
infatuated	O
as	O
to	O
imagine	O
itself	O
a	O
match	O
for	O
the	O
combined	O
efforts	O
of	O
the	O
union	.
if	O
this	O
reflection	O
be	O
just	,
there	O
is	O
less	O
danger	O
of	O
resistance	O
from	O
irregular	O
combinations	O
of	O
individuals	O
to	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
confederacy	O

to	O
that	O
of	O

this	O

an	O
observation	,
which	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
the	O
less	O
just	O
because	O
to	O
some	O
it	O
may	O
appear	O
new	;
which	O
is	,
that	O
the	O
more	O
the	O
operations	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
authority	O
are	O
intermingled	O
in	O
the	O
ordinary	O
exercise	O
of	O

a	O

hardly	O
be	O
expected	O
to	O

the	O
inference	O
is	,
that	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
affections	O
of	O
the	O

than	O
weakened	,
by	O
its	O

<bos>	O
one	O
thing	,
at	O
all	O
events	,
must	O
be	O
evident	,
that	O
a	O
government	O
like	O
the	O
one	O
proposed	O
would	O
bid	O
much	O
fairer	O
to	O
avoid	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O

force	,
than	O
that	O
species	O
of	O

for	O
by	O

of	O
its	O
opponents	;
the	O
authority	O
of	O
which	O
should	O
only	O
operate	O
upon	O
the	O
states	O
in	O
their	O
political	O
or	O
collective	O
capacities	.
it	O
has	O
been	O
shown	O
that	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
confederacy	O
there	O
can	O
be	O
no	O
sanction	O
for	O
the	O
laws	O
but	O
force	;
that	O
frequent	O
delinquencies	O
in	O
the	O
members	O
are	O
the	O
natural	O
offspring	O
of	O
the	O
very	O
frame	O
of	O
the	O
government	;
and	O
that	O
as	O
often	O
as	O
these	O
happen	,
they	O
can	O
only	O
be	O
redressed	,
if	O
at	O

to	O
the	O
individual	O

this	O

may	O

they	O
are	O
in	O

as	O

a	O
government	O
ought	O
to	O
contain	O
in	O
itself	O
every	O
power	O
requisite	O
to	O
the	O
full	O
accomplishment	O
of	O
the	O
objects	O
committed	O
to	O
its	O
care	,
and	O
to	O
the	O
complete	O
execution	O
of	O
the	O
trusts	O
for	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
responsible	,
free	O
from	O
every	O
other	O
control	O
but	O
a	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
good	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
sense	O
of	O
the	O
people	.

as	O
the	O
duties	O

defense	O
and	O
of	O
securing	O
the	O
public	O
peace	O
against	O
foreign	O

a	O
provision	O
for	O
casualties	O
and	O
dangers	O
to	O
which	O
no	O
possible	O
limits	O
can	O
be	O
assigned	,
the	O
power	O
of	O

that	O
provision	O

to	O
know	O
no	O

bounds	O
than	O
the	O
exigencies	O

the	O

of	O

<bos>	O
as	O
revenue	O
is	O
the	O
essential	O
engine	O
by	O
which	O
the	O
means	O
of	O
answering	O
the	O
national	O
exigencies	O
must	O
be	O
procured	,
the	O
power	O
of	O
procuring	O
that	O
article	O

full	O
extent	O

necessarily	O
be	O
comprehended	O
in	O
that	O
of	O
providing	O
for	O
those	O
exigencies	.

<bos>	O
as	O
theory	O
and	O
practice	O
conspire	O
to	O
prove	O
that	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
procuring	O
revenue	O
is	O
unavailing	O
when	O
exercised	O
over	O
the	O
states	O
in	O
their	O
collective	O
capacities	,
the	O
federal	O
government	O
must	O
of	O
necessity	O
be	O
invested	O
with	O
an	O
unqualified	O
power	O
of	O
taxation	O
in	O
the	O
ordinary	O
modes	.

<bos>	O
did	O
not	O
experience	O
evince	O
the	O
contrary	,
it	O
would	O
be	O
natural	O
to	O
conclude	O
that	O
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
a	O
general	O
power	O
of	O
taxation	O
in	O
the	O
national	O
government	O
might	O
safely	O
be	O

the	O

of	O
these	O
propositions	,
unassisted	O
by	O
any	O
additional	O
arguments	O
or	O

but	O
we	O
find	,
in	O
fact	,
that	O
the	O
antagonists	O
of	O
the	O
proposed	O
constitution	,
so	O
far	O
from	O
acquiescing	O
in	O
their	O
justness	O
or	O
truth	,
seem	O
to	O
make	O
their	O
principal	O
and	O
most	O
zealous	O
effort	O
against	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
plan	.
it	O
may	O
therefore	O
be	O
satisfactory	O
to	O
analyze	O
the	O
arguments	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
combat	O
it	.

<bos>	O
those	O
of	O
them	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
most	O
labored	O
with	O
that	O

seem	O
in	O
substance	O
to	O
amount	O
to	O
this	:
``	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
true	,
because	O
the	O
exigencies	O
of	O
the	O

may	O
not	O
be	O
susceptible	O
of	O
limitation	,
that	O
its	O

to	O

the	O
purposes	O
of	O
the	O

with	O
the	O
latter	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

it	O
is	,
therefore	,
as	O
necessary	O
that	O
the	O
state	O

should	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
command	O
the	O

of	O

the	O

faculty	O
in	O

to	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

but	O
an	O
indefinite	O
power	O
of	O
taxation	O
in	O
the	O
latter	O
might	,

probably	O
would	O
in	O

deprive	O
the	O
former	O
of	O
the	O
means	O
of	O
providing	O
for	O
their	O

and	O
would	O
subject	O
them	O
entirely	O
to	O
the	O
mercy	O
of	O
the	O
national	O

as	O
the	O
laws	O
of	O
the	O

are	O
to	O

might	O
at	O
any	O

abolish	O
the	O

upon	O
the	O

of	O
an	O

thus	O
all	O

appears	O
sometimes	O
to	O
turn	O
upon	O
the	O
supposition	O

in	O
the	O

it	O

in	O
the	O
state	O

to	O
encroach	O
upon	O
the	O

of	O

is	O

to	O
encroach	O

what	O

a	O

the	O
natural	O
conclusion	O
is	O
that	O
such	O

will	O
be	O
most	O
apt	O
to	O
end	O
to	O
the	O

it	O

that	O

that	O
it	O
is	O
by	O

the	O

the	O

<bos>	O
this	,
all	O

considered	,
is	O
the	O
most	O
eligible	O
provision	O
that	O
could	O

devised	.
it	O

extravagant	O
to-day	,
might	O
in	O
half	O

penurious	O

upon	O

can	O
never	O

from	O
his	O
duty	O
by	O
the	O
apprehension	O

eligible	O
situation	.
the	O
clause	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
quoted	O
combines	O
both	O
advantages	.
the	O
salaries	O
of	O
judicial	O
officers	O
may	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time	O
be	O
altered	,
as	O

with	O
which	O
any	O

judge	O
comes	O
into	O
office	,
in	O

to	O
him	.
it	O
will	O
be	O
observed	O
that	O
a	O
difference	O
has	O
been	O
made	O
by	O
the	O
convention	O
between	O
the	O
compensation	O
of	O
the	O
president	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
judges	,
that	O
of	O
the	O
former	O
can	O
neither	O
be	O
increased	O
nor	O
diminished	;
that	O
of	O
the	O
latter	O
can	O
only	O
not	O
be	O
diminished	.
this	O
probably	O
arose	O
from	O
the	O
difference	O
in	O
the	O
duration	O
of	O
the	O
respective	O
offices	.
as	O
the	O
president	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
elected	O
for	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
four	O
years	,
it	O
can	O
rarely	O
happen	O
that	O
an	O
adequate	O
salary	,
fixed	O
at	O
the	O
commencement	O
of	O
that	O
period	,
will	O
not	O
continue	O
to	O
be	O
such	O
to	O
its	O
end	.
but	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
judges	,
who	,
if	O
they	O
behave	O
properly	,
will	O
be	O
secured	O
in	O
their	O
places	O
for	O
life	,
it	O
may	O
well	O
happen	,
especially	O
in	O
the	O
early	O
stages	O
of	O
the	O
government	,
that	O
a	O
stipend	,
which	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
sufficient	O
at	O
their	O
first	O
appointment	,
would	O
become	O
too	O
small	O
in	O
the	O
progress	O
of	O
their	O
service	.

<bos>	O
this	O
provision	O
for	O
the	O
support	O
of	O
the	O
judges	O
bears	O
every	O
mark	O
of	O
prudence	O
and	O
efficacy	;
and	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
safely	O
affirmed	O
that	,
together	O
with	O
the	O
permanent	O
tenure	O
of	O
their	O
offices	,
it	O
affords	O
a	O
better	O
prospect	O
of	O
their	O
independence	O
than	O
is	O
discoverable	O
in	O
the	O
constitutions	O
of	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
states	O
in	O
regard	O
to	O
their	O
own	O
judges	.

<bos>	O
the	O
precautions	O
for	O
their	O
responsibility	O
are	O
comprised	O
in	O
the	O
article	O
respecting	O
impeachments	.
they	O
are	O
liable	O
to	O
be	O
impeached	O
for	O
malconduct	O
by	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	,
and	O
tried	O
by	O
the	O
senate	;
and	,
if	O
convicted	,
may	O
be	O
dismissed	O
from	O
office	,
and	O
disqualified	O
for	O
holding	O
any	O
other	.
this	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
provision	O
on	O
the	O
point	O
which	O
is	O
consistent	O
with	O
the	O
necessary	O
independence	O
of	O
the	O
judicial	O
character	,
and	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
one	O
which	O
we	O
find	O
in	O
our	O
own	O
constitution	O
in	O
respect	O
to	O
our	O
own	O
judges	.

the	O
want	O
of	O
a	O
provision	O
for	O
removing	O
the	O
judges	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
inability	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
subject	O
of	O
complaint	.
but	O
all	O
considerate	O
men	O
will	O
be	O
sensible	O
that	O
such	O
a	O
provision	O
would	O
either	O
not	O
be	O
practiced	O
upon	O
or	O
would	O
be	O
more	O

in	O

and	O
perhaps	O
in	O
several	O
of	O

as	O

the	O
declamations	O
to	O

hence	,
say	O
they	,
as	O
the	O
constitution	O
has	O
established	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
in	O
criminal	O
cases	,
and	O
is	O
silent	O
in	O
respect	O
to	O
civil	,
this	O
silence	O
is	O
an	O
implied	O
prohibition	O
of	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
in	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
latter	.

<bos>	O
the	O
rules	O
of	O
legal	O
interpretation	O
are	O
rules	O
of	O
commonsense	,
adopted	O
by	O
the	O
courts	O
in	O
the	O
construction	O
of	O
the	O

the	O
true	O
test	,
therefore	,
of	O
a	O
just	O
application	O
of	O
them	O
is	O
its	O
conformity	O
to	O
the	O
source	O
from	O
which	O

this	O
being	O
the	O
case	,
let	O
me	O
ask	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
consistent	O
with	O
common-sense	O
to	O
suppose	O
that	O
a	O
provision	O
obliging	O
the	O
legislative	O
power	O
to	O
commit	O
the	O
trial	O
of	O
criminal	O
causes	O
to	O
juries	,
is	O
a	O
privation	O
of	O
its	O
right	O
to	O
authorize	O
or	O
permit	O
that	O
mode	O
of	O
trial	O
in	O
other	O
cases	?
is	O
it	O
natural	O
to	O
suppose	,
that	O
a	O
command	O
to	O
do	O
one	O
thing	O
is	O
a	O
prohibition	O
to	O
the	O
doing	O
of	O
another	,
which	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
previous	O
power	O
to	O
do	,
and	O
which	O
is	O
not	O
incompatible	O
with	O
the	O
thing	O
commanded	O
to	O
be	O
done	?
if	O
such	O
a	O
supposition	O
would	O
be	O
unnatural	O
and	O
unreasonable	,
it	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
rational	O
to	O
maintain	O
that	O
an	O
injunction	O
of	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
in	O
certain	O
cases	O
is	O
an	O
interdiction	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
others	.

<bos>	O
a	O
power	O
to	O
constitute	O
courts	O
is	O
a	O
power	O
to	O
prescribe	O
the	O
mode	O
of	O
trial	;
and	O
consequently	,
if	O
nothing	O
was	O
said	O
in	O
the	O
constitution	O
on	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
juries	,
the	O

be	O
at	O

either	O
to	O

that	O
institution	O

to	O

it	O
alone	.
this	O
discretion	,
in	O

to	O
criminal	O

abridged	O
by	O
the	O
express	O
injunction	O
of	O
trial	O

it	O
is	,

at	O

obligation	O
to	O

in	O
a	O

the	O
obligation	O
or	O
necessity	O
of	O
employing	O
the	O

mode	O
in	O

does	O
not	O
abridge	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	O
to	O
exercise	O
that	O
mode	O
if	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
thought	O
proper	.
the	O
pretense	,

that	O

to	O
submit	O
all	O
the	O
civil	O
causes	O
of	O

cognizance	O
to	O
the	O
determination	O
of	O

is	O
a	O
pretense	O
destitute	O
of	O
all	O
just	O
foundation	.

<bos>	O
from	O
these	O
observations	O
this	O
conclusion	O
results	:
that	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
in	O
civil	O
cases	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
abolished	;
and	O
that	O
the	O
use	O
attempted	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
of	O
the	O
maxims	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
quoted	,
is	O
contrary	O
to	O
reason	O
and	O
common-sense	,
and	O
therefore	O
not	O
admissible	.
even	O
if	O
these	O
maxims	O
had	O
a	O
precise	O
technical	O
sense	,
corresponding	O
with	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
employ	O
them	O
upon	O
the	O
present	O
occasion	,
which	,
however	,
is	O
not	O
the	O
case	,
they	O
would	O
still	O
be	O
inapplicable	O
to	O
a	O
constitution	O
of	O
government	.
in	O
relation	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
subject	,
the	O
natural	O
and	O
obvious	O
sense	O
of	O
its	O
provisions	,
apart	O
from	O
any	O
technical	O
rules	,
is	O
the	O
true	O
criterion	O
of	O
construction	.

<bos>	O
having	O
now	O
seen	O
that	O
the	O
maxims	O
relied	O
upon	O
will	O
not	O
bear	O
the	O
use	O
made	O
of	O
them	,
let	O
us	O
endeavor	O
to	O
ascertain	O
their	O
proper	O
use	O
and	O
true	O
meaning	.
this	O
will	O
be	O
best	O
done	O
by	O
examples	.
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	O
declares	O
that	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
congress	,
or	,
in	O
other	O
words	,
of	O
the	O
national	O
legislature	,
shall	O
extend	O
to	O
certain	O
enumerated	O
cases	.
this	O
specification	O
of	O
particulars	O
evidently	O
excludes	O
all	O
pretension	O
to	O
a	O
general	O
legislative	O
authority	,
because	O
an	O
affirmative	O
grant	O
of	O
special	O
powers	O
would	O
be	O
absurd	,
as	O
well	O
as	O
useless	,
if	O
a	O
general	O
authority	O
was	O
intended	.

<bos>	O
in	O
like	O
manner	O
the	O
judicial	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
federal	O
judicatures	O
is	O
declared	O
by	O
the	O
constitution	O
to	O
comprehend	O
certain	O
cases	O
particularly	O
specified	.
the	O
expression	O
of	O
those	O
cases	O
marks	O
the	O
precise	O
limits	,
beyond	O
which	O
the	O
federal	O
courts	O
can	O
not	O
extend	O
their	O
jurisdiction	,
because	O
the	O
objects	O
of	O
their	O
cognizance	O
being	O
enumerated	,
the	O
specification	O
would	O
be	O
nugatory	O
if	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
exclude	O
all	O
ideas	O
of	O
more	O
extensive	O
authority	.

<bos>	O
these	O
examples	O
are	O
sufficient	O
to	O
elucidate	O
the	O
maxims	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
mentioned	,
and	O
to	O
designate	O
the	O
manner	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
used	.
but	O
that	O
there	O
may	O
be	O
no	O
misapprehensions	O
upon	O
this	O
subject	,
i	O
shall	O
add	O
one	O
case	O
more	,
to	O
demonstrate	O
the	O
proper	O
use	O
of	O
these	O
maxims	,
and	O
the	O
abuse	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
made	O
of	O
them	.

<bos>	O
let	O
us	O
suppose	O
that	O
by	O
the	O
laws	O
of	O
this	O
state	O
a	O
married	O
woman	O
was	O
incapable	O
of	O
conveying	O
her	O
estate	,
and	O
that	O
the	O
legislature	,
considering	O
this	O
as	O
an	O
evil	,
should	O
enact	O
that	O
she	O
might	O
dispose	O
of	O
her	O
property	O
by	O
deed	O
executed	O
in	O
the	O
presence	O
of	O
a	O
magistrate	.
in	O
such	O
a	O
case	O
there	O
can	O
be	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
the	O
specification	O
would	O
amount	O
to	O
an	O
exclusion	O
of	O
any	O
other	O
mode	O
of	O
conveyance	,
because	O
the	O
woman	O
having	O
no	O
previous	O
power	O
to	O
alienate	O
her	O
property	,
the	O
specification	O
determines	O
the	O
particular	O
mode	O
which	O
she	O
is	,
for	O
that	O
purpose	,
to	O
avail	O
herself	O
of	.
but	O
let	O
us	O
further	O
suppose	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
subsequent	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
act	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
declared	O
that	O
no	O
woman	O
should	O
dispose	O
of	O
any	O
estate	O
of	O
a	O
determinate	O
value	O
without	O
the	O
consent	O
of	O
three	O
of	O
her	O
nearest	O
relations	,
signified	O
by	O
their	O
signing	O
the	O
deed	;
could	O
it	O
be	O
inferred	O
from	O
this	O
regulation	O
that	O
a	O
married	O
woman	O
might	O
not	O
procure	O
the	O
approbation	O
of	O
her	O
relations	O
to	O
a	O
deed	O
for	O
conveying	O
property	O
of	O
inferior	O
value	?
the	O
position	O
is	O
too	O
absurd	O
to	O
merit	O
a	O
refutation	,
and	O
yet	O
this	O
is	O
precisely	O
the	O
position	O
which	O
those	O
must	O
establish	O
who	O
contend	O
that	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
juries	O
in	O
civil	O
cases	O
is	O
abolished	,
because	O
it	O
is	O
expressly	O
provided	O
for	O
in	O
cases	O
of	O
a	O
criminal	O
nature	.

<bos>	O
from	O
these	O
observations	O
it	O
must	O
appear	O
unquestionably	O
true	,
that	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
is	O
in	O
no	O
case	O
abolished	O
by	O
the	O
proposed	O
constitution	,
and	O
it	O
is	O
equally	O
true	,
that	O
in	O
those	O
controversies	O
between	O
individuals	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
great	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
are	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
interested	,
that	O
institution	O
will	O
remain	O
precisely	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
situation	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
placed	O
by	O
the	O
state	O
constitutions	,
and	O
will	O
be	O
in	O
no	O
degree	O
altered	O
or	O
influenced	O
by	O
the	O
adoption	O
of	O
the	O
plan	O
under	O
consideration	.
the	O
foundation	O
of	O
this	O
assertion	O
is	,
that	O
the	O
national	O
judiciary	O
will	O
have	O
no	O
cognizance	O
of	O
them	,
and	O
of	O
course	O
they	O
will	O
remain	O
determinable	O
as	O
heretofore	O
by	O
the	O
state	O
courts	O
only	,
and	O
in	O
the	O
manner	O
which	O
the	O
state	O
constitutions	O
and	O
laws	O
prescribe	.
all	O
land	O
causes	,
except	O
where	O
claims	O
under	O
the	O
grants	O
of	O
different	O
states	O
come	O
into	O
question	,
and	O
all	O
other	O
controversies	O
between	O
the	O
citizens	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
state	,
unless	O
where	O
they	O
depend	O
upon	O
positive	O
violations	O
of	O
the	O
articles	O
of	O
union	,
by	O
acts	O
of	O
the	O
state	O

will	O
belong	O
exclusively	O
to	O
the	O
jurisdiction	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
tribunals	.
add	O
to	O
this	,
that	O
admiralty	O
causes	,
and	O
almost	O
all	O
those	O
which	O
are	O
of	O
equity	O
jurisdiction	,
are	O
determinable	O
under	O
our	O
own	O
government	O
without	O
the	O
intervention	O
of	O
a	O
jury	,
and	O
the	O
inference	O
from	O
the	O
whole	O
will	O
be	,
that	O
this	O
institution	,
as	O
it	O
exists	O
with	O
us	O
at	O
present	,
can	O
not	O
possibly	O
be	O
affected	O
to	O
any	O
great	O
extent	O
by	O
the	O
proposed	O
alteration	O
in	O
our	O
system	O
of	O
government	.

the	O

of	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	,
if	O
they	O

nothing	O

concur	O
at	O

in	O
the	O
value	O
they	O
set	O
upon	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	;
or	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
any	O
difference	O
between	O

it	O
consists	O
in	O
this	:
the	O
former	O
regard	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
valuable	O

to	O
liberty	;
the	O

represent	O
it	O
as	O
the	O
very	O
palladium	O
of	O
free	O
government	.
for	O
my	O

part	,
the	O
more	O
the	O
operation	O
of	O
the	O
institution	O

fallen	O
under	O

observation	,
the	O
more	O
reason	O
i	O
have	O
discovered	O
for	O
holding	O
it	O
in	O
high	O
estimation	;
and	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
altogether	O
superfluous	O
to	O
examine	O
to	O
what	O
extent	O
it	O
deserves	O
to	O
be	O
esteemed	O
useful	O
or	O
essential	O
in	O
a	O
representative	O
republic	,
or	O
how	O
much	O
more	O
merit	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
entitled	O
to	,
as	O
a	O
defense	O
against	O
the	O
oppressions	O
of	O
an	O
hereditary	O
monarch	,
than	O
as	O
a	O
barrier	O
to	O
the	O
tyranny	O
of	O
popular	O
magistrates	O
in	O
a	O
popular	O
government	.
discussions	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
curious	O
than	O
beneficial	,
as	O
all	O
are	O
satisfied	O
of	O
the	O
utility	O
of	O
the	O
institution	,
and	O
of	O
its	O
friendly	O
aspect	O
to	O
liberty	.
but	O
i	O
must	O
acknowledge	O
that	O
i	O
can	O
not	O
readily	O
discern	O
the	O
inseparable	O
connection	O
between	O
the	O
existence	O
of	O
liberty	,
and	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
in	O
civil	O
cases	.
arbitrary	O
impeachments	,
arbitrary	O
methods	O
of	O
prosecuting	O
pretended	O
offenses	,
and	O
arbitrary	O
punishments	O
upon	O
arbitrary	O
convictions	,
have	O
ever	O
appeared	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
great	O
engines	O
of	O
judicial	O
despotism	;
and	O
these	O
have	O
all	O
relation	O
to	O
criminal	O
proceedings	.
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
in	O
criminal	O
cases	,
aided	O
by	O
the	O
habeas-corpus	O
act	,
seems	O
therefore	O
to	O
be	O
alone	O
concerned	O
in	O
the	O
question	.
and	O
both	O
of	O
these	O
are	O
provided	O
for	,
in	O
the	O
most	O
ample	O
manner	,
in	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	.

<bos>	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
observed	,
that	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
is	O
a	O
safeguard	O
against	O
an	O
oppressive	O
exercise	O
of	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
taxation	.
this	O
observation	O
deserves	O
to	O
be	O
canvassed	.

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
it	O
can	O
have	O
no	O
influence	O
upon	O
the	O
legislature	,
in	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
taxes	O
to	O
be	O
laid	,
to	O
the	O
objects	O
upon	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
imposed	,
or	O
to	O
the	O
rule	O
by	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
apportioned	.
if	O
it	O
can	O
have	O
any	O
influence	,
therefore	,
it	O
must	O
be	O
upon	O
the	O
mode	O
of	O
collection	,
and	O
the	O
conduct	O
of	O
the	O
officers	O
intrusted	O
with	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
the	O
revenue	O
laws	.

<bos>	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
mode	O
of	O
collection	O
in	O
this	O
state	,
under	O
our	O
own	O
constitution	,
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
is	O
in	O
most	O
cases	O
out	O
of	O
use	.
the	O
taxes	O
are	O
usually	O
levied	O
by	O
the	O
more	O
summary	O
proceeding	O
of	O
distress	O
and	O
sale	,
as	O
in	O
cases	O
of	O
rent	.
and	O
it	O
is	O
acknowledged	O
on	O
all	O
hands	,
that	O
this	O
is	O
essential	O
to	O
the	O
efficacy	O
of	O
the	O
revenue	O
laws	.
the	O
dilatory	O
course	O
of	O
a	O
trial	O
at	O
law	O
to	O
recover	O
the	O
taxes	O
imposed	O
on	O
individuals	,
would	O
neither	O
suit	O
the	O
exigencies	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
nor	O
promote	O
the	O
convenience	O
of	O
the	O

it	O
would	O
often	O
occasion	O
an	O
accumulation	O
of	O
costs	,
more	O
burdensome	O
than	O
the	O
original	O

the	O
provision	O

abuses	O
of	O

to	O
the	O
oppression	O
of	O
the	O

every	O
species	O
of	O

offenses	O
against	O

<bos>	O
the	O
excellence	O
of	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
in	O
civil	O
cases	O
appears	O
to	O
depend	O
on	O
circumstances	O
foreign	O
to	O
the	O
preservation	O
of	O
liberty	.
the	O
strongest	O
argument	O
in	O
its	O
favor	O
is	,
that	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
security	O
against	O
corruption	.
as	O
there	O
is	O
always	O
more	O
time	O
and	O
better	O
opportunity	O
to	O
tamper	O
with	O
a	O
standing	O
body	O
of	O
magistrates	O
than	O
with	O
a	O
jury	O
summoned	O
for	O
the	O
occasion	,
there	O
is	O
room	O
to	O
suppose	O
that	O
a	O
corrupt	O
influence	O
would	O
more	O
easily	O
find	O
its	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
former	O
than	O
to	O
the	O
latter	.
the	O
force	O
of	O
this	O
consideration	O
is	,
however	,
diminished	O
by	O
others	.
the	O
sheriff	,
who	O
is	O
the	O
summoner	O
of	O
ordinary	O
juries	,
and	O
the	O
clerks	O
of	O
courts	,
who	O
have	O
the	O
nomination	O
of	O
special	O
juries	,
are	O
themselves	O
standing	O
officers	,
and	,
acting	O
individually	,
may	O
be	O
supposed	O
more	O
accessible	O
to	O
the	O
touch	O
of	O
corruption	O
than	O
the	O
judges	,
who	O
are	O
a	O
collective	O
body	.
it	O
is	O
not	O
difficult	O
to	O
see	,
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
those	O
officers	O
to	O
select	O
jurors	O
who	O
would	O
serve	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
the	O
party	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
a	O
corrupted	O
bench	.
in	O
the	O
next	O
place	,
it	O
may	O
fairly	O
be	O
supposed	,
that	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
less	O
difficulty	O
in	O
gaining	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
jurors	O
promiscuously	O
taken	O
from	O
the	O
public	O
mass	,
than	O
in	O
gaining	O
men	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
chosen	O
by	O
the	O
government	O
for	O
their	O
probity	O
and	O
good	O
character	.
but	O
making	O
every	O
deduction	O
for	O
these	O
considerations	,
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
must	O
still	O
be	O
a	O
valuable	O
check	O
upon	O
corruption	.
it	O
greatly	O
multiplies	O
the	O
impediments	O
to	O
its	O
success	.
as	O
matters	O
now	O
stand	,
it	O
would	O
be	O
necessary	O
to	O
corrupt	O
both	O
court	O
and	O
jury	;
for	O
where	O
the	O
jury	O
have	O
gone	O
evidently	O
wrong	,
the	O
court	O
will	O
generally	O
grant	O
a	O
new	O
trial	,
and	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
in	O
most	O
cases	O
of	O
little	O
use	O
to	O
practice	O
upon	O
the	O
jury	,
unless	O
the	O
court	O
could	O
be	O
likewise	O
gained	.
here	O
then	O
is	O
a	O
double	O
security	;
and	O
it	O
will	O
readily	O
be	O
perceived	O
that	O
this	O
complicated	O
agency	O
tends	O
to	O
preserve	O
the	O
purity	O
of	O
both	O
institutions	.
by	O
increasing	O
the	O
obstacles	O
to	O
success	,
it	O
discourages	O
attempts	O
to	O
seduce	O
the	O
integrity	O
of	O
either	.
the	O
temptations	O
to	O
prostitution	O
which	O
the	O
judges	O
might	O
have	O
to	O
surmount	,
must	O
certainly	O
be	O
much	O
fewer	,
while	O
the	O
co-operation	O
of	O
a	O
jury	O
is	O
necessary	,
than	O
they	O
might	O
be	,
if	O
they	O
had	O
themselves	O
the	O
exclusive	O
determination	O
of	O
all	O
causes	.

<bos>	O
notwithstanding	,
therefore	,
the	O
doubts	O
i	O
have	O
expressed	,
as	O
to	O
the	O
essentiality	O
of	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
in	O
civil	O
cases	O
to	O
liberty	,
i	O
admit	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
in	O
most	O
cases	,
under	O
proper	O
regulations	,
an	O
excellent	O
method	O
of	O
determining	O
questions	O
of	O
property	;
and	O
that	O
on	O
this	O
account	O
alone	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
entitled	O
to	O
a	O
constitutional	O
provision	O
in	O
its	O
favor	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
possible	O
to	O
fix	O
the	O
limits	O
within	O
which	O
it	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
comprehended	.
there	O
is	,
however	,
in	O
all	O
cases	,
great	O
difficulty	O
in	O
this	;
and	O
men	O
not	O
blinded	O
by	O
enthusiasm	O
must	O
be	O
sensible	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
federal	O
government	,
which	O
is	O
a	O
composition	O
of	O
societies	O
whose	O
ideas	O
and	O
institutions	O
in	O
relation	O
to	O
the	O
matter	O
materially	O
vary	O
from	O
each	O
other	,
that	O
difficulty	O
must	O
be	O
not	O
a	O
little	O
augmented	.
for	O
my	O
own	O
part	,
at	O
every	O
new	O
view	O
i	O
take	O
of	O
the	O
subject	,
i	O
become	O
more	O
convinced	O
of	O
the	O
reality	O
of	O
the	O
obstacles	O
which	,
we	O
are	O
authoritatively	O
informed	,
prevented	O
the	O
insertion	O
of	O
a	O
provision	O
on	O
this	O
head	O
in	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	.

<bos>	O
the	O
great	O
difference	O
between	O
the	O
limits	O
of	O
the	O
jury	O
trial	O
in	O
different	O
states	O
is	O
not	O
generally	O
understood	;
and	O
as	O
it	O
must	O
have	O
considerable	O
influence	O
on	O
the	O
sentence	O
we	O
ought	O
to	O
pass	O
upon	O
the	O
omission	O

of	O
in	O

to	O
this	O
point	,
an	O
explanation	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
necessary	.
in	O
this	O

more	O
nearly	O
than	O
in	O
any	O

those	O
of	O

a	O

neither	O

in	O

in	O

i	O
believe	,
however	,
that	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
those	O

which	O
have	O

courts	O
of	O
admiralty	,
the	O

in	O

are	O
triable	O
by	O
juries	.
in	O
georgia	O
there	O
are	O
none	O
but	O
common-law	O
courts	,
and	O
an	O
appeal	O
of	O
course	O
lies	O
from	O
the	O
verdict	O
of	O
one	O
jury	O
to	O
another	,
which	O
is	O
called	O
a	O
special	O
jury	,
and	O
for	O
which	O
a	O
particular	O
mode	O
of	O
appointment	O
is	O
marked	O
out	.
in	O
connecticut	,
they	O
have	O
no	O
distinct	O
courts	O
either	O
of	O
chancery	O
or	O
of	O
admiralty	,
and	O
their	O
courts	O
of	O

have	O
no	O
jurisdiction	O
of	O

a	O

their	O
general	O

in	O
connecticut	,
therefore	,
the	O
trial	O
by	O

extends	O
in	O
practice	O
further	O
than	O
in	O
any	O
other	O

rhode	O

i	O
believe	,
in	O
this	O
particular	,
pretty	O
much	O
in	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
connecticut	.
massachusetts	O

in	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
blending	O
of	O

and	O
admiralty	O
jurisdictions	,
are	O
in	O
a	O
similar	O
predicament	.
in	O
the	O
four	O
eastern	O
states	,
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
not	O
only	O
stands	O
upon	O
a	O
broader	O
foundation	O
than	O
in	O
the	O
other	O
states	,
but	O
it	O
is	O
attended	O
with	O
a	O
peculiarity	O
unknown	,
in	O
its	O
full	O
extent	,
to	O
any	O
of	O
them	.
there	O
is	O
an	O
appeal	O
of	O
course	O
from	O
one	O
jury	O
to	O
another	,
till	O
there	O
have	O
been	O
two	O
verdicts	O
out	O
of	O
three	O
on	O
one	O
side	.

<bos>	O
from	O
this	O
sketch	O
it	O
appears	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
material	O
diversity	,
as	O
well	O
in	O
the	O
modification	O
as	O
in	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
the	O
institution	O
of	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
in	O
civil	O
cases	,
in	O
the	O
several	O
states	;
and	O
from	O
this	O
fact	O
these	O
obvious	O
reflections	O
flow	:
first	,
that	O
no	O
general	O
rule	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
fixed	O
upon	O
by	O
the	O
convention	O
which	O
would	O
have	O
corresponded	O
with	O
the	O
circumstances	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
states	;
and	O
secondly	,
that	O
more	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
as	O
much	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
hazarded	O
by	O
taking	O
the	O
system	O
of	O
any	O
one	O
state	O
for	O
a	O
standard	,
as	O
by	O
omitting	O
a	O
provision	O
altogether	O
and	O
leaving	O
the	O
matter	,
as	O
has	O
been	O
done	,
to	O
legislative	O
regulation	.

<bos>	O
the	O
propositions	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
made	O
for	O
supplying	O
the	O
omission	O
have	O
rather	O
served	O
to	O
illustrate	O
than	O
to	O
obviate	O
the	O
difficulty	O
of	O
the	O
thing	.
the	O
minority	O
of	O
pennsylvania	O
have	O
proposed	O
this	O
mode	O
of	O
expression	O
for	O
the	O
purpose	O
``	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
shall	O
be	O
as	O
heretofore	O
''	O
and	O
this	O
i	O
maintain	O
would	O
be	O
senseless	O
and	O
nugatory	.
the	O
united	O
states	,
in	O
their	O
united	O
or	O
collective	O
capacity	,
are	O
the	O
object	O
to	O
which	O
all	O
general	O
provisions	O
in	O
the	O
constitution	O
must	O
necessarily	O
be	O
construed	O
to	O
refer	.
now	O
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
though	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	,
with	O
various	O
limitations	,
is	O
known	O
in	O
each	O
state	O
individually	,
yet	O
in	O
the	O
united	O
states	,
as	O
such	,
it	O
is	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
altogether	O
unknown	,
because	O
the	O
present	O
federal	O
government	O
has	O
no	O
judiciary	O
power	O
whatever	;
and	O
consequently	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
proper	O
antecedent	O
or	O
previous	O
establishment	O
to	O
which	O
the	O
term	O
heretofore	O
could	O
relate	.
it	O
would	O
therefore	O
be	O
destitute	O
of	O
a	O
precise	O
meaning	,
and	O
inoperative	O
from	O
its	O
uncertainty	.

<bos>	O
as	,
on	O
the	O
one	O
hand	,
the	O
form	O
of	O
the	O
provision	O
would	O
not	O
fulfil	O
the	O
intent	O
of	O
its	O
proposers	,
so	,
on	O
the	O
other	,
if	O
i	O
apprehend	O
that	O
intent	O
rightly	,
it	O
would	O
be	O
in	O
itself	O
inexpedient	.
i	O
presume	O
it	O
to	O
be	,
that	O
causes	O
in	O
the	O
federal	O
courts	O
should	O
be	O
tried	O
by	O
jury	,
if	,
in	O
the	O
state	O
where	O
the	O
courts	O
sat	,
that	O
mode	O
of	O
trial	O
would	O
obtain	O
in	O
a	O
similar	O
case	O
in	O
the	O
state	O
courts	;
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	,
admiralty	O
causes	O
should	O
be	O
tried	O
in	O
connecticut	O
by	O
a	O
jury	,
in	O
new	O
york	O
without	O
one	.
the	O
capricious	O
operation	O
of	O
so	O
dissimilar	O
a	O
method	O
of	O
trial	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
cases	,
under	O
the	O
same	O
government	,
is	O
of	O
itself	O
sufficient	O
to	O
indispose	O
every	O
wellregulated	O
judgment	O
towards	O
it	.
whether	O
the	O
cause	O
should	O
be	O
tried	O
with	O
or	O
without	O
a	O
jury	,
would	O
depend	,
in	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
cases	,
on	O
the	O
accidental	O
situation	O
of	O
the	O
court	O
and	O
parties	.

<bos>	O
but	O
this	O
is	O
not	,
in	O
my	O
estimation	,
the	O
greatest	O
objection	.
i	O
feel	O
a	O
deep	O
and	O
deliberate	O
conviction	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
cases	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
is	O
an	O
ineligible	O
one	.
i	O
think	O
it	O
so	O
particularly	O
in	O
cases	O
which	O
concern	O
the	O
public	O
peace	O
with	O
foreign	O
nations	O
that	O
is	,
in	O
most	O
cases	O
where	O
the	O
question	O
turns	O
wholly	O
on	O
the	O
laws	O
of	O
nations	.
of	O
this	O
nature	,
among	O
others	,
are	O
all	O
prize	O
causes	.
juries	O
can	O

investigations	O
that	O

a	O
thorough	O
knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
laws	O
and	O
usages	O
of	O
nations	;
and	O
they	O

be	O
under	O
the	O

of	O

will	O
not	O

them	O

sufficient	O
regard	O
to	O
those	O
considerations	O
of	O
public	O
policy	O
which	O
ought	O
to	O
guide	O
their	O
inquiries	.
there	O
would	O
of	O
course	O
be	O
always	O
danger	O
that	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
other	O
nations	O
might	O
be	O
infringed	O
by	O
their	O
decisions	,
so	O
as	O
to	O
afford	O
occasions	O
of	O
reprisal	O
and	O
war	.
though	O
the	O
proper	O
province	O
of	O
juries	O
be	O
to	O
determine	O
matters	O
of	O
fact	,
yet	O
in	O
most	O
cases	O
legal	O
consequences	O
are	O
complicated	O
with	O
fact	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
as	O
to	O
render	O
a	O
separation	O
impracticable	.

<bos>	O
it	O
will	O
add	O
great	O
weight	O
to	O
this	O
remark	,
in	O
relation	O
to	O
prize	O
causes	,
to	O
mention	O
that	O
the	O
method	O
of	O
determining	O
them	O
has	O
been	O
thought	O
worthy	O
of	O
particular	O
regulation	O
in	O
various	O
treaties	O
between	O
different	O
powers	O
of	O
europe	,
and	O
that	,
pursuant	O
to	O
such	O
treaties	,
they	O
are	O
determinable	O
in	O
great	O
britain	,
in	O
the	O
last	O
resort	,
before	O
the	O
king	O
himself	,
in	O
his	O
privy	O
council	,
where	O
the	O
fact	,
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
law	,
undergoes	O
a	O
re-examination	.
this	O
alone	O
demonstrates	O
the	O
impolicy	O
of	O
inserting	O
a	O
fundamental	O
provision	O
in	O
the	O
constitution	O
which	O
would	O
make	O
the	O
state	O
systems	O
a	O
standard	O
for	O
the	O
national	O
government	O
in	O
the	O
article	O
under	O
consideration	,
and	O
the	O
danger	O
of	O
encumbering	O
the	O
government	O
with	O
any	O
constitutional	O
provisions	O
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
which	O
is	O
not	O
indisputable	.

<bos>	O
my	O
convictions	O
are	O
equally	O
strong	O
that	O
great	O
advantages	O
result	O
from	O
the	O
separation	O
of	O
the	O
equity	O
from	O
the	O
law	O
jurisdiction	,
and	O
that	O
the	O
causes	O
which	O
belong	O
to	O
the	O
former	O
would	O
be	O
improperly	O
committed	O
to	O
juries	.
the	O
great	O
and	O
primary	O
use	O
of	O
a	O
court	O
of	O
equity	O
is	O
to	O
give	O
relief	O
in	O
extraordinary	O
cases	,
which	O
are	O
exceptions2	O
to	O
general	O
rules	.
to	O
unite	O
the	O
jurisdiction	O
of	O
such	O
cases	O
with	O
the	O
ordinary	O
jurisdiction	,
must	O
have	O
a	O
tendency	O
to	O
unsettle	O
the	O
general	O
rules	,
and	O
to	O
subject	O
every	O
case	O
that	O
arises	O
to	O
a	O
special	O
determination	;
while	O
a	O
separation	O
of	O
the	O
one	O
from	O
the	O
other	O
has	O
the	O
contrary	O
effect	O
of	O
rendering	O
one	O
a	O
sentinel	O
over	O
the	O
other	,
and	O
of	O
keeping	O
each	O
within	O
the	O
expedient	O
limits	.
besides	O
this	,
the	O
circumstances	O
that	O
constitute	O
cases	O
proper	O
for	O
courts	O
of	O
equity	O
are	O
in	O
many	O
instances	O
so	O
nice	O
and	O
intricate	,
that	O
they	O
are	O
incompatible	O
with	O
the	O
genius	O
of	O
trials	O
by	O
jury	.
they	O
require	O
often	O
such	O
long	,
deliberate	,
and	O
critical	O
investigation	O
as	O
would	O
be	O
impracticable	O
to	O
men	O
called	O
from	O
their	O
occupations	,
and	O
obliged	O
to	O
decide	O
before	O
they	O
were	O
permitted	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
them	.
the	O
simplicity	O
and	O
expedition	O
which	O
form	O
the	O
distinguishing	O
characters	O
of	O
this	O
mode	O
of	O
trial	O
require	O
that	O
the	O
matter	O
to	O
be	O
decided	O
should	O
be	O
reduced	O
to	O
some	O
single	O
and	O
obvious	O
point	;
while	O
the	O
litigations	O
usual	O
in	O
chancery	O
frequently	O
comprehend	O
a	O
long	O
train	O
of	O
minute	O
and	O
independent	O
particulars	.

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O
true	O
that	O
the	O
separation	O
of	O
the	O
equity	O
from	O
the	O
legal	O
jurisdiction	O
is	O
peculiar	O
to	O
the	O
english	O
system	O
of	O
jurisprudence	:
which	O
is	O
the	O
model	O
that	O
has	O
been	O
followed	O
in	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
states	.
but	O
it	O
is	O
equally	O
true	O
that	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
has	O
been	O
unknown	O
in	O
every	O
case	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
have	O
been	O
united	.
and	O
the	O
separation	O
is	O
essential	O
to	O
the	O
preservation	O
of	O
that	O
institution	O
in	O
its	O
pristine	O
purity	.
the	O
nature	O
of	O
a	O
court	O
of	O
equity	O
will	O
readily	O
permit	O
the	O
extension	O
of	O
its	O
jurisdiction	O
to	O
matters	O
of	O
law	;
but	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
be	O
suspected	,
that	O
the	O
attempt	O
to	O
extend	O
the	O
jurisdiction	O
of	O
the	O
courts	O
of	O
law	O
to	O
matters	O
of	O
equity	O
will	O
not	O
only	O
be	O
unproductive	O
of	O
the	O
advantages	O
which	O
may	O
be	O
derived	O
from	O
courts	O
of	O
chancery	,
on	O
the	O
plan	O
upon	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
established	O
in	O
this	O
state	,
but	O
will	O
tend	O
gradually	O
to	O
change	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
courts	O
of	O
law	,
and	O
to	O
undermine	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	,
by	O
introducing	O
questions	O
too	O
complicated	O
for	O
a	O
decision	O
in	O
that	O
mode	.

<bos>	O
these	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
conclusive	O
reasons	O
against	O
incorporating	O
the	O
systems	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
states	,
in	O
the	O
formation	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
judiciary	,
according	O
to	O
what	O
may	O
be	O
conjectured	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
attempt	O
of	O
the	O
pennsylvania	O
minority	.
let	O
us	O
now	O
examine	O
how	O
far	O
the	O
proposition	O
of	O
massachusetts	O
is	O
calculated	O
to	O
remedy	O
the	O
supposed	O
defect	.

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O
in	O
this	O
form	:
``	O
in	O
civil	O
actions	O
between	O
citizens	O
of	O
different	O
states	,
every	O
issue	O
of	O
fact	,
arising	O
in	O
actions	O
at	O
common	O
law	,
may	O
be	O
tried	O
by	O
a	O
jury	O
if	O
the	O
parties	,
or	O
either	O
of	O
them	O
request	O
it	.
''	O

<bos>	O
this	,
at	O
best	,
is	O
a	O
proposition	O
confined	O
to	O
one	O
description	O
of	O
causes	;
and	O
the	O
inference	O
is	O
fair	,
either	O
that	O
the	O
massachusetts	O
convention	O
considered	O
that	O
as	O
the	O
only	O
class	O
of	O
federal	O
causes	,
in	O
which	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
would	O
be	O
proper	;
or	O
that	O
if	O
desirous	O
of	O
a	O
more	O
extensive	O
provision	,
they	O
found	O
it	O
impracticable	O
to	O
devise	O
one	O
which	O
would	O
properly	O
answer	O
the	O
end	.
if	O
the	O
first	,
the	O
omission	O
of	O
a	O
regulation	O
respecting	O
so	O
partial	O
an	O
object	O
can	O
never	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
a	O
material	O
imperfection	O
in	O
the	O
system	.
if	O
the	O
last	,
it	O
affords	O
a	O
strong	O
corroboration	O
of	O
the	O
extreme	O
difficulty	O
of	O
the	O
thing	.

<bos>	O
but	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
all	:
if	O
we	O
advert	O
to	O
the	O
observations	O
already	O
made	O
respecting	O
the	O
courts	O
that	O
subsist	O
in	O
the	O
several	O
states	O
of	O
the	O
union	,
and	O
the	O
different	O
powers	O
exercised	O
by	O
them	,
it	O
will	O
appear	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
no	O
expressions	O
more	O
vague	O
and	O
indeterminate	O
than	O
those	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
employed	O
to	O
characterize	O
that	O
species	O
of	O
causes	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
intended	O
shall	O
be	O
entitled	O
to	O
a	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	.
in	O
this	O
state	,
the	O
boundaries	O
between	O
actions	O
at	O
common	O
law	O
and	O
actions	O
of	O
equitable	O
jurisdiction	,
are	O
ascertained	O
in	O
conformity	O
to	O
the	O
rules	O
which	O
prevail	O
in	O
england	O
upon	O
that	O
subject	.
in	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
states	O
the	O
boundaries	O
are	O
less	O
precise	.
in	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
every	O
cause	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
tried	O
in	O
a	O
court	O
of	O
common	O
law	,
and	O
upon	O
that	O
foundation	O
every	O
action	O
may	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
an	O
action	O
at	O
common	O
law	,
to	O
be	O
determined	O
by	O
a	O
jury	,
if	O
the	O
parties	,
or	O
either	O
of	O
them	,
choose	O
it	.
hence	O
the	O
same	O
irregularity	O
and	O
confusion	O
would	O
be	O
introduced	O
by	O
a	O
compliance	O
with	O
this	O
proposition	,
that	O
i	O
have	O
already	O
noticed	O
as	O
resulting	O
from	O
the	O
regulation	O
proposed	O
by	O
the	O
pennsylvania	O
minority	.
in	O
one	O
state	O
a	O
cause	O
would	O
receive	O
its	O
determination	O
from	O
a	O
jury	,
if	O
the	O
parties	,
or	O
either	O
of	O
them	,
requested	O
it	;
but	O
in	O
another	O
state	,
a	O
cause	O
exactly	O
similar	O
to	O
the	O
other	,
must	O
be	O
decided	O
without	O
the	O
intervention	O
of	O
a	O
jury	,
because	O
the	O
state	O
judicatories	O
varied	O
as	O
to	O
common-law	O
jurisdiction	.

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O
obvious	,
therefore	,
that	O
the	O
massachusetts	O
proposition	,
upon	O
this	O
subject	O
can	O
not	O
operate	O
as	O
a	O
general	O
regulation	,
until	O
some	O
uniform	O
plan	,
with	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
limits	O
of	O
common-law	O
and	O
equitable	O
jurisdictions	,
shall	O
be	O
adopted	O
by	O
the	O
different	O
states	.
to	O
devise	O
a	O
plan	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
is	O
a	O
task	O
arduous	O
in	O
itself	,
and	O
which	O
it	O
would	O
require	O
much	O
time	O
and	O
reflection	O
to	O
mature	.
it	O
would	O
be	O
extremely	O
difficult	,
if	O
not	O
impossible	,
to	O
suggest	O
any	O
general	O
regulation	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
acceptable	O
to	O
all	O
the	O
states	O
in	O
the	O
union	,
or	O
that	O
would	O
perfectly	O
quadrate	O
with	O
the	O
several	O
state	O
institutions	.

<bos>	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
asked	,
why	O
could	O
not	O
a	O
reference	O
have	O
been	O
made	O
to	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
this	O
state	,
taking	O
that	,
which	O
is	O
allowed	O
by	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
good	O
one	,
as	O
a	O
standard	O
for	O
the	O
united	O
states	?
i	O
answer	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
very	O
probable	O
the	O
other	O
states	O
would	O
entertain	O
the	O
same	O
opinion	O
of	O
our	O
institutions	O
as	O
we	O
do	O
ourselves	.
it	O
is	O
natural	O
to	O
suppose	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
hitherto	O
more	O
attached	O
to	O
their	O
own	,
and	O
that	O
each	O
would	O
struggle	O
for	O
the	O
preference	.
if	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
taking	O
one	O
state	O
as	O
a	O
model	O
for	O
the	O
whole	O
had	O
been	O
thought	O
of	O
in	O
the	O
convention	,
it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
presumed	O
that	O
the	O
adoption	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
that	O
body	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
rendered	O
difficult	O
by	O
the	O
predilection	O
of	O
each	O
representation	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
its	O
own	O
government	;
and	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
uncertain	O
which	O
of	O
the	O
states	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
taken	O
as	O
the	O
model	.
it	O
has	O
been	O
shown	O
that	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
would	O
be	O
improper	O
ones	.
and	O
i	O
leave	O
it	O
to	O
conjecture	,
whether	,
under	O
all	O
circumstances	,
it	O
is	O
most	O
likely	O
that	O
new	O
york	,
or	O
some	O
other	O
state	,
would	O
have	O
been	O
preferred	.
but	O
admit	O
that	O
a	O
judicious	O
selection	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
effected	O
in	O
the	O
convention	,
still	O
there	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
great	O
danger	O
of	O
jealousy	O
and	O
disgust	O
in	O
the	O
other	O
states	,
at	O
the	O
partiality	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
shown	O
to	O
the	O
institutions	O
of	O
one	.
the	O
enemies	O
of	O
the	O
plan	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
furnished	O
with	O
a	O
fine	O
pretext	O
for	O
raising	O
a	O
host	O
of	O
local	O
prejudices	O
against	O
it	,
which	O
perhaps	O
might	O
have	O
hazarded	,
in	O
no	O
inconsiderable	O
degree	,
its	O
final	O
establishment	.

<bos>	O
to	O
avoid	O
the	O
embarrassments	O
of	O
a	O
definition	O
of	O
the	O
cases	O
which	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
ought	O
to	O
embrace	,
it	O
is	O
sometimes	O
suggested	O
by	O
men	O
of	O
enthusiastic	O
tempers	,
that	O
a	O
provision	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
inserted	O
for	O
establishing	O
it	O
in	O
all	O
cases	O
whatsoever	.
for	O
this	O
i	O
believe	,
no	O
precedent	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
any	O
member	O
of	O
the	O
union	;
and	O
the	O
considerations	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
stated	O
in	O
discussing	O
the	O
proposition	O
of	O
the	O
minority	O
of	O
pennsylvania	,
must	O
satisfy	O
every	O
sober	O
mind	O
that	O
the	O
establishment	O
of	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
in	O
all	O
cases	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
an	O
unpardonable	O
error	O
in	O
the	O
plan	.

<bos>	O
in	O
short	,
the	O
more	O
it	O
is	O
considered	O
the	O
more	O
arduous	O
will	O
appear	O
the	O
task	O
of	O
fashioning	O
a	O
provision	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
form	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
express	O
too	O
little	O
to	O
answer	O
the	O
purpose	,
or	O
too	O
much	O
to	O
be	O
advisable	;
or	O
which	O
might	O
not	O
have	O
opened	O
other	O
sources	O
of	O
opposition	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
and	O
essential	O
object	O
of	O
introducing	O
a	O
firm	O
national	O
government	.

<bos>	O
i	O
can	O
not	O
but	O
persuade	O
myself	,
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	,
that	O
the	O
different	O
lights	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
subject	O
has	O
been	O
placed	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
these	O
observations	,
will	O
go	O
far	O
towards	O
removing	O
in	O
candid	O
minds	O
the	O
apprehensions	O
they	O
may	O
have	O
entertained	O
on	O
the	O
point	.
they	O

that	O
the	O

only	O
in	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O

provided	O
for	O
in	O
the	O
most	O

cases	,
and	O
those	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
great	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
community	O
is	O
interested	,
that	O
mode	O
of	O
trial	O
will	O
remain	O
in	O
its	O
full	O
force	,
as	O
established	O
in	O
the	O
state	O
constitutions	,
untouched	O
and	O
unaffected	O
by	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O

that	O
it	O
is	O
in	O
no	O
case	O

by	O

that	O
there	O
are	O
great	O

not	O
insurmountable	O
difficulties	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
making	O
any	O
precise	O
and	O
proper	O
provision	O
for	O
it	O
in	O

constitution	O

<bos>	O
the	O
best	O
judges	O
of	O
the	O

will	O
be	O
the	O

anxious	O
for	O
a	O
constitutional	O
establishment	O
of	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
in	O
civil	O
cases	,
and	O
will	O
be	O
the	O
most	O
ready	O
to	O
admit	O
that	O
the	O
changes	O
which	O
are	O
continually	O
happening	O
in	O
the	O
affairs	O
of	O
society	O
may	O
render	O
a	O
different	O
mode	O
of	O
determining	O
questions	O
of	O
property	O
preferable	O
in	O
many	O
cases	O
in	O
which	O
that	O
mode	O
of	O
trial	O
now	O
prevails	.
for	O
my	O
part	,
i	O
acknowledge	O
myself	O
to	O
be	O
convinced	O
that	O
even	O
in	O
this	O
state	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
advantageously	O
extended	O
to	O
some	O
cases	O
to	O
which	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
at	O
present	O
apply	,
and	O
might	O
as	O
advantageously	O
be	O
abridged	O
in	O
others	.
it	O
is	O
conceded	O
by	O
all	O
reasonable	O
men	O
that	O
it	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
obtain	O
in	O
all	O
cases	.
the	O
examples	O
of	O
innovations	O
which	O
contract	O
its	O
ancient	O
limits	,
as	O
well	O
in	O
these	O
states	O
as	O
in	O
great	O
britain	,
afford	O
a	O
strong	O
presumption	O
that	O
its	O
former	O
extent	O
has	O
been	O
found	O
inconvenient	,
and	O
give	O
room	O
to	O
suppose	O
that	O
future	O
experience	O
may	O
discover	O
the	O
propriety	O
and	O
utility	O
of	O
other	O
exceptions	.
i	O
suspect	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
impossible	O
in	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
thing	O
to	O
fix	O
the	O
salutary	O
point	O
at	O
which	O
the	O
operation	O
of	O
the	O
institution	O
ought	O
to	O
stop	,
and	O
this	O
is	O
with	O
me	O
a	O
strong	O
argument	O
for	O
leaving	O
the	O
matter	O
to	O
the	O
discretion	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	.

<bos>	O
this	O
is	O
now	O
clearly	O
understood	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
case	O
in	O
great	O
britain	,
and	O
it	O
is	O
equally	O
so	O
in	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
connecticut	;
and	O
yet	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
safely	O
affirmed	O
that	O
more	O
numerous	O
encroachments	O
have	O
been	O
made	O
upon	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
in	O
this	O
state	O
since	O
the	O
revolution	,
though	O
provided	O
for	O
by	O
a	O
positive	O
article	O
of	O
our	O
constitution	,
than	O
has	O
happened	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
either	O
in	O
connecticut	O
or	O
great	O
britain	.
it	O
may	O
be	O
added	O
that	O
these	O
encroachments	O
have	O
generally	O
originated	O
with	O
the	O
men	O
who	O
endeavor	O
to	O
persuade	O
the	O
people	O
they	O
are	O
the	O
warmest	O
defenders	O
of	O
popular	O
liberty	,
but	O
who	O
have	O
rarely	O
suffered	O
constitutional	O
obstacles	O
to	O
arrest	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
favorite	O
career	.
the	O
truth	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
general	O
genius	O
of	O
a	O
government	O
is	O
all	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
substantially	O
relied	O
upon	O
for	O
permanent	O
effects	.
particular	O
provisions	,
though	O
not	O
altogether	O
useless	,
have	O
far	O
less	O
virtue	O
and	O
efficacy	O
than	O
are	O
commonly	O
ascribed	O
to	O
them	;
and	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
them	O
will	O
never	O
be	,
with	O
men	O
of	O
sound	O
discernment	,
a	O
decisive	O
objection	O
to	O
any	O
plan	O
which	O
exhibits	O
the	O
leading	O
characters	O
of	O
a	O
good	O
government	.

<bos>	O
it	O
certainly	O
sounds	O
not	O
a	O
little	O
harsh	O
and	O
extraordinary	O
to	O
affirm	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
security	O
for	O
liberty	O
in	O
a	O
constitution	O
which	O
expressly	O
establishes	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	O
in	O
criminal	O
cases	,
because	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
do	O
it	O
in	O
civil	O
also	;
while	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
notorious	O
fact	O
that	O
connecticut	,
which	O
has	O
been	O
always	O
regarded	O
as	O
the	O
most	O
popular	O
state	O
in	O
the	O
union	,
can	O
boast	O
of	O
no	O
constitutional	O
provision	O
for	O
either	.

''	O
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
this	O
provision	O
is	O
so	O
evident	O
in	O
itself	,

it	O
is	,
at	O
the	O

consonant	O
to	O

to	O

which	O
were	O

to	O

reflection	O
that	O
the	O
fate	O
of	O

fellow-creature	O
depended	O
on	O
his	O
sole	O
fiat	,
would	O
naturally	O
inspire	O
scrupulousness	O
and	O
caution	;
the	O
dread	O
of	O
being	O
accused	O
of	O
weakness	O
or	O
connivance	,
would	O
beget	O
equal	O
circumspection	,
though	O
of	O
a	O
different	O
kind	.
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	,
as	O
men	O
generally	O
derive	O
confidence	O
from	O
their	O
numbers	,
they	O
might	O
often	O
encourage	O
each	O
other	O
in	O
an	O
act	O
of	O
obduracy	,
and	O
might	O

suspicion	O

for	O

on	O
these	O
accounts	,
one	O
man	O
appears	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
more	O
eligible	O
dispenser	O
of	O

a	O

<bos>	O
the	O
expediency	O
of	O
vesting	O

i	O

been	O
only	O
contested	O
in	O
relation	O
to	O
the	O
crime	O
of	O
treason	.
this	,
it	O
has	O
been	O
urged	,
ought	O
to	O
have	O
depended	O
upon	O
the	O
assent	O
of	O
one	,
or	O
both	,
of	O
the	O
branches	O
of	O
the	O

body	.
i	O
shall	O
not	O
deny	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
strong	O
reasons	O
to	O
be	O
assigned	O
for	O
requiring	O
in	O
this	O
particular	O
the	O
concurrence	O
of	O
that	O
body	,
or	O
of	O
a	O
part	O

as	O
treason	O
is	O
a	O
crime	O
levelled	O
at	O
the	O
immediate	O
being	O
of	O
the	O
society	,
when	O
the	O
laws	O
have	O
once	O
ascertained	O
the	O
guilt	O
of	O
the	O
offender	,
there	O
seems	O
a	O
fitness	O
in	O
referring	O
the	O
expediency	O
of	O
an	O
act	O
of	O
mercy	O
towards	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
judgment	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	.
and	O
this	O
ought	O
the	O
rather	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
case	,
as	O
the	O
supposition	O
of	O
the	O
connivance	O
of	O
the	O
chief	O
magistrate	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
entirely	O
excluded	.
but	O
there	O
are	O
also	O
strong	O
objections	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
plan	.
it	O
is	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
doubted	,
that	O
a	O
single	O
man	O
of	O
prudence	O
and	O
good	O
sense	O
is	O
better	O
fitted	,
in	O
delicate	O
conjunctures	,
to	O
balance	O
the	O
motives	O
which	O
may	O
plead	O
for	O
and	O
against	O
the	O
remission	O
of	O
the	O
punishment	,
than	O
any	O
numerous	O
body	O
whatever	.
it	O
deserves	O
particular	O
attention	,
that	O
treason	O
will	O
often	O
be	O
connected	O
with	O
seditions	O
which	O
embrace	O
a	O
large	O
proportion	O
of	O
the	O
community	;
as	O
lately	O
happened	O
in	O
massachusetts	.
in	O
every	O
such	O
case	,
we	O
might	O
expect	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
representation	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
tainted	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
spirit	O
which	O
had	O
given	O
birth	O
to	O
the	O
offense	.
and	O
when	O
parties	O
were	O
pretty	O
equally	O
matched	,
the	O
secret	O
sympathy	O
of	O
the	O
friends	O
and	O
favorers	O
of	O
the	O
condemned	O
person	,
availing	O
itself	O
of	O
the	O
good-nature	O
and	O
weakness	O
of	O
others	,
might	O
frequently	O
bestow	O
impunity	O
where	O
the	O
terror	O
of	O
an	O
example	O
was	O
necessary	.

<bos>	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	,
when	O
the	O
sedition	O
had	O
proceeded	O
from	O
causes	O
which	O
had	O
inflamed	O
the	O
resentments	O
of	O
the	O
major	O
party	,
they	O
might	O
often	O
be	O
found	O
obstinate	O
and	O
inexorable	,
when	O
policy	O
demanded	O
a	O
conduct	O
of	O
forbearance	O
and	O
clemency	.
but	O
the	O
principal	O
argument	O
for	O
reposing	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
pardoning	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
to	O
the	O
chief	O
magistrate	O
is	O
this	:
in	O
seasons	O
of	O
insurrection	O
or	O
rebellion	,
there	O
are	O
often	O
critical	O
moments	,
when	O
a	O
welltimed	O
offer	O
of	O
pardon	O
to	O
the	O
insurgents	O
or	O
rebels	O
may	O
restore	O
the	O
tranquillity	O
of	O
the	O
commonwealth	;
and	O
which	,
if	O
suffered	O
to	O
pass	O
unimproved	,
it	O
may	O
never	O
be	O
possible	O
afterwards	O
to	O
recall	.
the	O
dilatory	O
process	O
of	O
convening	O
the	O
legislature	,
or	O
one	O
of	O
its	O
branches	,
for	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
obtaining	O
its	O
sanction	O
to	O
the	O
measure	,
would	O
frequently	O
be	O
the	O
occasion	O
of	O
letting	O
slip	O
the	O
golden	O
opportunity	.
the	O
loss	O
of	O
a	O
week	,
a	O
day	,
an	O
hour	,
may	O
sometimes	O
be	O
fatal	.
if	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
observed	,
that	O
a	O
discretionary	O
power	,
with	O
a	O
view	O
to	O
such	O
contingencies	,
might	O
be	O
occasionally	O
conferred	O
upon	O
the	O
president	,
it	O
may	O
be	O
answered	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	,
that	O
it	O
is	O
questionable	,
whether	,
in	O
a	O
limited	O
constitution	,
that	O
power	O
could	O
be	O
delegated	O
by	O
law	;
and	O
in	O
the	O
second	O
place	,
that	O
it	O
would	O
generally	O
be	O
impolitic	O
beforehand	O
to	O
take	O
any	O
step	O
which	O
might	O
hold	O
out	O
the	O
prospect	O
of	O
impunity	.
a	O
proceeding	O
of	O
this	O
kind	,
out	O
of	O
the	O
usual	O
course	,
would	O
be	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
construed	O
into	O
an	O
argument	O
of	O
timidity	O
or	O
of	O
weakness	,
and	O
would	O
have	O
a	O
tendency	O
to	O
embolden	O
guilt	.

it	O

even	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
the	O

where	O
this	O

was	O

we	O
find	O
unnecessary	O

i	O
call	O
them	O
unnecessary	,
because	O
the	O
reason	O
which	O
had	O
introduced	O
a	O
similar	O
provision	O
into	O
the	O
english	O
bill	O
of	O

by	O
no	O
construction	O
be	O
deemed	O
to	O
reside	O
anywhere	O
else	,
than	O
in	O
the	O

themselves	;
and	O
it	O
was	O
superfluous	,
if	O
not	O
absurd	,
to	O
declare	O
that	O
a	O
matter	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
done	O
without	O
the	O
consent	O
of	O

in	O
that	O

this	O

new	O

which	O
has	O
been	O
justly	O
celebrated	,
both	O
in	O
europe	O

as	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
the	O
forms	O

government	O
established	O
in	O
this	O
country	,
there	O
is	O
a	O
total	O
silence	O
upon	O
the	O
subject	.

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O
remarkable	,
that	O
even	O
in	O
the	O
two	O
states	O
which	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
meditated	O
an	O
interdiction	O
of	O
military	O
establishments	O
in	O
time	O
of	O

the	O
mode	O
of	O
expression	O
made	O
use	O
of	O
is	O
rather	O
cautionary	O
than	O
prohibitory	.
it	O
is	O
not	O
said	,
that	O
standing	O

shall	O
not	O
be	O

but	O
that	O
they	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
kept	O
up	,
in	O
time	O
of	O

this	O
ambiguity	O
of	O
terms	O
appears	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
result	O
of	O
a	O
conflict	O
between	O
jealousy	O
and	O
conviction	;
between	O
the	O
desire	O
of	O
excluding	O
such	O
establishments	O
at	O
all	O
events	,
and	O
the	O
persuasion	O
that	O
an	O
absolute	O
exclusion	O
would	O
be	O
unwise	O
and	O
unsafe	.

<bos>	O
can	O
it	O
be	O
doubted	O
that	O
such	O
a	O
provision	,
whenever	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
public	O
affairs	O
was	O
understood	O
to	O
require	O
a	O
departure	O
from	O
it	,
would	O
be	O
interpreted	O
by	O
the	O
legislature	O
into	O
a	O
mere	O
admonition	,
and	O
would	O
be	O
made	O
to	O
yield	O
to	O
the	O
necessities	O
or	O
supposed	O
necessities	O
of	O
the	O
state	?
let	O
the	O
fact	O
already	O
mentioned	,
with	O
respect	O
to	O
pennsylvania	,
decide	.
what	O
then	(
it	O
may	O
be	O
asked	)
is	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
provision	,
if	O
it	O
cease	O
to	O

the	O
moment	O
there	O
is	O
an	O
inclination	O
to	O

it	?

<bos>	O
let	O
us	O
examine	O
whether	O
there	O
be	O
any	O
comparison	,
in	O
point	O
of	O
efficacy	,
between	O
the	O
provision	O
alluded	O
to	O

which	O
is	O

to	O
effect	O
nothing	;
the	O

by	O
steering	O

of	O

by	O

compatible	O
with	O
a	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

a	O

the	O

he	O
took	O
his	O
seat	O
in	O

would	O

can	O
it	O

that	O

to	O

or	O
bold	O
or	O
honest	O
enough	O
to	O

of	O
their	O
danger	?
if	O
such	O
presumptions	O
can	O
fairly	O
be	O
made	,
there	O
ought	O
at	O
once	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
end	O
of	O
all	O
delegated	O
authority	.
the	O
people	O
should	O
resolve	O
to	O
recall	O
all	O
the	O
powers	O
they	O
have	O
heretofore	O
parted	O
with	O
out	O
of	O

to	O
divide	O
themselves	O
into	O
as	O

be	O
reasonably	O
made	,
still	O
the	O
concealment	O
of	O
the	O
design	,
for	O
any	O
duration	,
would	O
be	O
impracticable	.
it	O
would	O
be	O
announced	,
by	O
the	O
very	O
circumstance	O
of	O
augmenting	O
the	O
army	O
to	O
so	O
great	O
an	O
extent	O
in	O
time	O
of	O
profound	O
peace	.
what	O
colorable	O
reason	O
could	O
be	O
assigned	,
in	O
a	O
country	O
so	O
situated	,
for	O
such	O
vast	O
augmentations	O
of	O
the	O
military	O
force	?
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
could	O
be	O
long	O
deceived	;
and	O
the	O
destruction	O
of	O
the	O
project	,
and	O
of	O
the	O
projectors	,
would	O
quickly	O
follow	O
the	O

it	O
has	O

that	O
the	O
provision	O
which	O

the	O
appropriation	O
of	O
money	O
for	O
the	O
support	O
of	O
an	O
army	O
to	O
the	O
period	O
of	O
two	O
years	O
would	O
be	O
unavailing	,
because	O
the	O
executive	,
when	O
once	O
possessed	O
of	O
a	O
force	O
large	O
enough	O
to	O
awe	O
the	O
people	O
into	O
submission	,
would	O
find	O
resources	O
in	O
that	O
very	O
force	O
sufficient	O
to	O
enable	O
him	O
to	O
dispense	O
with	O
supplies	O
from	O
the	O
acts	O
of	O
the	O

but	O
the	O
question	O
again	O
recurs	,
upon	O
what	O
pretense	O
could	O
he	O
be	O
put	O
in	O
possession	O
of	O
a	O
force	O
of	O
that	O
magnitude	O
in	O
time	O
of	O
peace	?
if	O
we	O
suppose	O
it	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
created	O
in	O
consequence	O
of	O
some	O
domestic	O
insurrection	O
or	O
foreign	O
war	,
then	O
it	O
becomes	O
a	O
case	O
not	O
within	O
the	O
principles	O
of	O
the	O
objection	;
for	O
this	O
is	O
levelled	O
against	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
keeping	O
up	O
troops	O
in	O
time	O
of	O
peace	.
few	O
persons	O
will	O
be	O
so	O
visionary	O
as	O
seriously	O
to	O
contend	O
that	O
military	O
forces	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
raised	O
to	O
quell	O
a	O
rebellion	O
or	O
resist	O
an	O
invasion	;
and	O
if	O
the	O
defense	O
of	O
the	O
community	O
under	O
such	O
circumstances	O
should	O
make	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
have	O
an	O
army	O
so	O
numerous	O
as	O
to	O
hazard	O
its	O
liberty	,
this	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
calamaties	O
for	O
which	O
there	O
is	O
neither	O
preventative	O
nor	O
cure	.
it	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
provided	O
against	O
by	O
any	O
possible	O
form	O
of	O
government	;
it	O
might	O
even	O
result	O
from	O
a	O
simple	O
league	O
offensive	O
and	O
defensive	,
if	O
it	O
should	O
ever	O
be	O
necessary	O
for	O
the	O
confederates	O
or	O
allies	O
to	O
form	O
an	O
army	O
for	O
common	O
defense	.

<bos>	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
an	O
evil	O
infinitely	O
less	O
likely	O
to	O
attend	O
us	O
in	O
a	O
united	O
than	O
in	O
a	O
disunited	O
state	;
nay	,
it	O
may	O
be	O
safely	O
asserted	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
an	O
evil	O
altogether	O
unlikely	O
to	O
attend	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
latter	O
situation	.
it	O
is	O
not	O
easy	O
to	O
conceive	O
a	O
possibility	O
that	O
dangers	O
so	O
formidable	O
can	O
assail	O
the	O
whole	O
union	,
as	O
to	O
demand	O
a	O
force	O
considerable	O
enough	O
to	O
place	O
our	O
liberties	O
in	O
the	O
least	O
jeopardy	,
especially	O
if	O
we	O
take	O
into	O
our	O
view	O
the	O
aid	O
to	O
be	O
derived	O
from	O
the	O
militia	,
which	O
ought	O
always	O
to	O
be	O
counted	O
upon	O
as	O
a	O
valuable	O
and	O
powerful	O
auxiliary	.
but	O
in	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
disunion	(
as	O
has	O
been	O
fully	O
shown	O
in	O
another	O
place	)
the	O
contrary	O
of	O
this	O
supposition	O
would	O
become	O
not	O
only	O
probable	,
but	O
almost	O
unavoidable	.

the	O
erection	O
of	O
a	O
new	O
government	,
whatever	O
care	O
or	O
wisdom	O
may	O
distinguish	O
the	O
work	,
can	O
not	O
fail	O
to	O
originate	O
questions	O
of	O
intricacy	O
and	O
nicety	;
and	O
these	O
may	,
in	O
a	O
particular	O
manner	,
be	O
expected	O
to	O
flow	O
from	O
the	O
establishment	O
of	O
a	O
constitution	O
founded	O
upon	O
the	O
total	O
or	O
partial	O
incorporation	O
of	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
distinct	O
sovereignties	.
't	O
is	O
time	O
only	O
that	O
can	O
mature	O
and	O
perfect	O
so	O
compound	O
a	O
system	,

liquidate	O
the	O

them	O
to	O
each	O

in	O
a	O
harmonious	O
and	O

whole	.

<bos>	O
such	O
questions	,
accordingly	,
have	O
arisen	O
upon	O
the	O
plan	O
proposed	O
by	O
the	O
convention	,
and	O

concerning	O
the	O
judiciary	O

which	O
are	O

this	O
to	O
be	O
exclusive	,
or	O
are	O
those	O
courts	O
to	O
possess	O
a	O
concurrent	O
jurisdiction	?
if	O
the	O
latter	,
in	O
what	O
relation	O
will	O
they	O
stand	O
to	O
the	O
national	O
tribunals	?
these	O
are	O
inquiries	O
which	O
we	O
meet	O
with	O
in	O
the	O
mouths	O
of	O
men	O
of	O
sense	,
and	O
which	O
are	O
certainly	O
entitled	O
to	O
attention	.

<bos>	O
the	O
principles	O
established	O
in	O
a	O
former	O
paper1	O
teach	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
states	O
will	O
retain	O
all	O
pre-existing	O
authorities	O
which	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
exclusively	O
delegated	O
to	O
the	O
federal	O
head	;
and	O
that	O
this	O
exclusive	O
delegation	O
can	O
only	O
exist	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
three	O
cases	:
where	O
an	O
exclusive	O
authority	O
is	,
in	O
express	O
terms	,
granted	O
to	O
the	O
union	;
or	O
where	O
a	O
particular	O
authority	O
is	O
granted	O
to	O
the	O
union	,
and	O
the	O
exercise	O
of	O
a	O
like	O
authority	O
is	O
prohibited	O
to	O
the	O
states	;
or	O
where	O
an	O
authority	O
is	O
granted	O
to	O
the	O
union	,
with	O
which	O
a	O
similar	O
authority	O
in	O
the	O
states	O
would	O
be	O
utterly	O
incompatible	.
though	O
these	O
principles	O
may	O
not	O
apply	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
force	O
to	O
the	O
judiciary	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
legislative	O
power	,
yet	O
i	O
am	O
inclined	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
they	O
are	,
in	O
the	O
main	,
just	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
former	,
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
latter	.
and	O
under	O
this	O
impression	,
i	O
shall	O
lay	O
it	O
down	O
as	O
a	O
rule	,
that	O
the	O
state	O
courts	O
will	O
retain	O
the	O
jurisdiction	O
they	O
now	O
have	,
unless	O
it	O
appears	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
away	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
enumerated	O
modes	.

<bos>	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
in	O
the	O
proposed	O
constitution	,
which	O
wears	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
confining	O
the	O
causes	O
of	O
federal	O
cognizance	O
to	O
the	O
federal	O
courts	,
is	O
contained	O
in	O
this	O
passage	:
``	O
the	O
judicial	O
power	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
shall	O
be	O
vested	O
in	O
one	O
supreme	O
court	,
and	O
in	O
such	O
inferior	O
courts	O
as	O
the	O
congress	O
shall	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time	O
ordain	O
and	O
establish	.
''	O
this	O
might	O
either	O
be	O
construed	O
to	O
signify	,
that	O
the	O
supreme	O
and	O
subordinate	O
courts	O
of	O
the	O
union	O
should	O
alone	O
have	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
deciding	O
those	O
causes	O
to	O
which	O
their	O
authority	O
is	O
to	O
extend	;
or	O
simply	O
to	O
denote	,
that	O
the	O
organs	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
judiciary	O
should	O
be	O
one	O
supreme	O
court	,
and	O
as	O
many	O
subordinate	O
courts	O
as	O
congress	O
should	O
think	O
proper	O
to	O
appoint	;
or	O
in	O
other	O
words	,
that	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
should	O
exercise	O
the	O
judicial	O
power	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
invested	,
through	O
one	O
supreme	O
tribunal	,
and	O
a	O
certain	O
number	O
of	O
inferior	O
ones	,
to	O
be	O
instituted	O
by	O
them	.
the	O
first	O
excludes	,
the	O
last	O
admits	,
the	O
concurrent	O
jurisdiction	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
tribunals	;
and	O
as	O
the	O
first	O
would	O
amount	O
to	O
an	O
alienation	O
of	O
state	O
power	O
by	O
implication	,
the	O
last	O
appears	O
to	O
me	O
the	O
most	O
natural	O
and	O
the	O
most	O
defensible	O
construction	.

<bos>	O
but	O
this	O
doctrine	O
of	O
concurrent	O
jurisdiction	O
is	O
only	O
clearly	O
applicable	O
to	O
those	O
descriptions	O
of	O
causes	O
of	O
which	O
the	O
state	O
courts	O
have	O
previous	O
cognizance	.
it	O
is	O
not	O
equally	O
evident	O
in	O
relation	O
to	O
cases	O
which	O
may	O
grow	O
out	O
of	,
and	O
be	O
peculiar	O
to	,
the	O
constitution	O
to	O
be	O
established	;
for	O
not	O
to	O
allow	O
the	O
state	O
courts	O
a	O
right	O
of	O
jurisdiction	O
in	O
such	O
cases	,
can	O
hardly	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
the	O
abridgment	O
of	O
a	O
pre-existing	O
authority	.
i	O
mean	O
not	O
therefore	O
to	O
contend	O
that	O
the	O
united	O
states	,
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
legislation	O
upon	O
the	O
objects	O
intrusted	O
to	O
their	O
direction	,
may	O
not	O
commit	O
the	O
decision	O
of	O
causes	O
arising	O
upon	O
a	O
particular	O
regulation	O
to	O
the	O
federal	O
courts	O
solely	,
if	O
such	O
a	O
measure	O
should	O
be	O
deemed	O
expedient	;
but	O
i	O
hold	O
that	O
the	O
state	O
courts	O
will	O
be	O
divested	O
of	O
no	O
part	O
of	O
their	O
primitive	O
jurisdiction	,
further	O
than	O
may	O
relate	O
to	O
an	O
appeal	;
and	O
i	O
am	O
even	O
of	O
opinion	O
that	O
in	O
every	O
case	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
expressly	O
excluded	O
by	O
the	O
future	O
acts	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
legislature	,
they	O
will	O
of	O
course	O
take	O
cognizance	O
of	O
the	O
causes	O
to	O
which	O
those	O
acts	O
may	O
give	O
birth	.
this	O
i	O
infer	O
from	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
judiciary	O
power	,
and	O
from	O
the	O
general	O
genius	O
of	O
the	O
system	.
the	O

in	O
the	O

of	O

as	O

the	O
inference	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
conclusive	,
that	O
the	O

would	O

it	O

<bos>	O
here	O
another	O
question	O
occurs	:
what	O
relation	O
would	O
subsist	O
between	O
the	O
national	O
and	O
state	O
courts	O
in	O
these	O
instances	O
of	O
concurrent	O
jurisdiction	?
i	O
answer	,
that	O
an	O
appeal	O
would	O
certainly	O
lie	O
from	O
the	O
latter	,
to	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	.
the	O
constitution	O
in	O
direct	O
terms	O
gives	O
an	O
appellate	O
jurisdiction	O
to	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
enumerated	O
cases	O
of	O
federal	O
cognizance	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
to	O
have	O
an	O
original	O
one	,
without	O
a	O
single	O
expression	O
to	O
confine	O
its	O
operation	O
to	O
the	O
inferior	O
federal	O
courts	.
the	O
objects	O
of	O
appeal	,
not	O
the	O
tribunals	O
from	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
made	,
are	O
alone	O
contemplated	.
from	O
this	O
circumstance	,
and	O
from	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
the	O
thing	,
it	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
construed	O
to	O
extend	O
to	O
the	O
state	O
tribunals	.
either	O
this	O
must	O
be	O
the	O
case	,
or	O
the	O
local	O
courts	O
must	O
be	O
excluded	O
from	O
a	O
concurrent	O
jurisdiction	O
in	O
matters	O
of	O
national	O
concern	,
else	O
the	O
judiciary	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
union	O
may	O
be	O
eluded	O
at	O
the	O
pleasure	O
of	O
every	O
plaintiff	O
or	O
prosecutor	.
neither	O
of	O
these	O
consequences	O
ought	,
without	O
evident	O
necessity	,
to	O
be	O
involved	;
the	O
latter	O
would	O
be	O
entirely	O
inadmissible	,
as	O
it	O
would	O
defeat	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
and	O
avowed	O
purposes	O
of	O
the	O
proposed	O
government	,
and	O
would	O
essentially	O
embarrass	O
its	O
measures	.
nor	O
do	O
i	O
perceive	O
any	O
foundation	O
for	O
such	O
a	O
supposition	.
agreeably	O
to	O
the	O
remark	O
already	O
made	,
the	O
national	O
and	O
state	O
systems	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
regarded	O
as	O
one	O
whole	.
the	O
courts	O
of	O
the	O

will	O
of	O
course	O
be	O
natural	O
auxiliaries	O
to	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
the	O
laws	O
of	O
the	O
union	,
and	O
an	O
appeal	O
from	O
them	O
will	O
as	O
naturally	O
lie	O
to	O
that	O
tribunal	O
which	O
is	O
destined	O
to	O
unite	O
and	O
assimilate	O
the	O
principles	O
of	O

and	O
the	O
rules	O
of	O
national	O

the	O
evident	O
aim	O
of	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	O
is	,
that	O
all	O
the	O
causes	O
of	O
the	O
specified	O
classes	O
shall	,
for	O
weighty	O
public	O
reasons	,
receive	O
their	O
original	O
or	O
final	O
determination	O
in	O
the	O
courts	O
of	O
the	O

to	O
confine	,
therefore	,
the	O
general	O
expressions	O
giving	O
appellate	O
jurisdiction	O
to	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	,
to	O
appeals	O
from	O
the	O
subordinate	O
federal	O
courts	,
instead	O
of	O
allowing	O
their	O
extension	O
to	O
the	O
state	O
courts	,
would	O
be	O
to	O
abridge	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
the	O
terms	,
in	O
subversion	O
of	O
the	O
intent	,
contrary	O
to	O
every	O
sound	O
rule	O
of	O
interpretation	.

<bos>	O
but	O
could	O
an	O
appeal	O
be	O
made	O
to	O
lie	O
from	O
the	O
state	O
courts	O
to	O
the	O
subordinate	O
federal	O
judicatories	?
this	O
is	O
another	O
of	O
the	O
questions	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
raised	,
and	O
of	O
greater	O
difficulty	O
than	O
the	O
former	.
the	O
following	O
considerations	O
countenance	O
the	O
affirmative	.
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O

in	O
the	O
first	O

all	O
this	O
seems	O
to	O

to	O
the	O

of	O

and	O
this	O
being	O
the	O

at	O

no	O

establishment	O
of	O
an	O

from	O

be	O

of	O

in	O

the	O

that	O
provision	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	O
which	O
authorizes	O

regulate	,
in	O
the	O
last	O

the	O
election	O

it	O
is	O
in	O
these	O
words	:
``	O
the	O
times	,

manner	O
of	O
holding	O
elections	O
for	O
senators	O

the	O

1	O
this	O
provision	O

declaimed	O
against	O
by	O
those	O
who	O
condemn	O
the	O
constitution	O
in	O
the	O

it	O
has	O
been	O
censured	O
by	O
those	O

in	O
one	O

any	O
article	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O

more	O
completely	O
defensible	O
than	O
this	.
its	O
propriety	O
rests	O
upon	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
this	O
plain	O
proposition	,
that	O
every	O
government	O
ought	O
to	O
contain	O
in	O
itself	O
the	O
means	O
of	O
its	O
own	O
preservation	.
every	O

approve	O
an	O
adherence	O
to	O
this	O
rule	,
in	O
the	O
work	O
of	O
the	O
convention	;

will	O
disapprove	O
every	O
deviation	O
from	O
it	O
which	O
may	O
not	O
appear	O
to	O

by	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O

work	O
some	O
particular	O
ingredient	,
with	O
which	O
a	O
rigid	O
conformity	O
to	O

even	O
in	O

to	O

regret	O
a	O
departure	O
from	O
so	O
fundamental	O
a	O
principle	,

a	O
portion	O

anarchy	.

it	O

it	O

it	O
will	,

as	O
readily	O

that	O
there	O

only	O
three	O
ways	O
in	O
which	O
this	O
power	O
could	O

been	O
reasonably	O
modified	O

disposed	:
that	O
it	O

primarily	O
in	O
the	O

ultimately	O
in	O
the	O
former	.
the	O
last	O
mode	O
has	,
with	O
reason	,
been	O
preferred	O
by	O

may	O
be	O

the	O

possibility	O
of	O
the	O

objection	.

for	O

the	O

if	O

as	O
a	O

the	O

an	O

view	O
of	O

fail	O
to	O
result	O
in	O
a	O
conviction	,
that	O

as	O
an	O
objection	O
to	O

it	O
may	O
be	O
remarked	O
that	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
the	O

would	O
involve	,
in	O
its	O
full	O
extent	,
the	O
danger	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
suggested	O
might	O
flow	O
from	O
an	O
exclusive	O
power	O
in	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	O
to	O
regulate	O
the	O
federal	O
elections	.
it	O
may	O
be	O
alleged	,
that	O
by	O
declining	O
the	O
appointment	O
of	O
senators	,
they	O
might	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
give	O
a	O
fatal	O
blow	O
to	O
the	O
union	;
and	O
from	O
this	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
inferred	,
that	O
as	O

existence	O
would	O
be	O
thus	O
rendered	O

upon	O
them	O

be	O
a	O

against	O

this	O
argument	,
though	O
specious	,
will	O
not	,
upon	O
examination	,
be	O
found	O
solid	.
it	O
is	O
certainly	O
true	O
that	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	,
by	O
forbearing	O
the	O
appointment	O
of	O
senators	,
may	O
destroy	O
the	O
national	O
government	.
but	O
it	O
will	O
not	O
follow	O
that	,
because	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
power	O
to	O
do	O
this	O
in	O
one	O
instance	,
they	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
it	O
in	O
every	O
other	.
there	O
are	O
cases	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
pernicious	O
tendency	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
power	O
may	O
be	O
far	O
more	O
decisive	,
without	O
any	O
motive	O
equally	O
cogent	O
with	O
that	O
which	O
must	O
have	O
regulated	O
the	O
conduct	O
of	O
the	O
convention	O
in	O

to	O
the	O
formation	O
of	O

recommend	O
their	O
admission	O
into	O
the	O

<bos>	O
so	O
far	O
as	O
that	O
construction	O
may	O
expose	O
the	O
union	O
to	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
injury	O
from	O
the	O
state	O

it	O
is	O
an	O
evil	;
but	O
it	O
is	O
an	O
evil	O
which	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
avoided	O
without	O
excluding	O
the	O
states	,
in	O
their	O
political	O
capacities	,
wholly	O
from	O
a	O
place	O
in	O
the	O
organization	O
of	O
the	O
national	O

if	O
this	O
had	O
been	O
done	,
it	O
would	O
doubtless	O
have	O
been	O
interpreted	O
into	O
an	O
entire	O
dereliction	O
of	O
the	O
federal	O
principle	;
and	O
would	O
certainly	O
have	O
deprived	O
the	O

of	O
that	O
absolute	O
safeguard	O
which	O
they	O
will	O
enjoy	O
under	O
this	O

it	O
may	O

an	O

of	O
a	O

a	O

it	O
may	O
be	O

that	O

of	O

of	O

<bos>	O
war	O
between	O
the	O

in	O
the	O
first	O
period	O
of	O

would	O
be	O
accompanied	O
with	O
much	O
greater	O

than	O
it	O

in	O

of	O

though	O
they	O
bear	O
a	O
malignant	O
aspect	O
to	O
liberty	O
and	O

have	,
notwithstanding	,
been	O
productive	O
of	O
the	O
signal	O
advantage	O
of	O

impracticable	,
and	O
of	O
preventing	O
that	O

of	O

prior	O
to	O

the	O

of	O

contributed	O
to	O
the	O

the	O

encircled	O
with	O

the	O

of	O
an	O

formerly	,
an	O
invading	O
army	O
would	O
penetrate	O
into	O
the	O
heart	O
of	O
a	O
neighboring	O
country	O
almost	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
intelligence	O
of	O
its	O
approach	O
could	O
be	O
received	;
but	O
now	O
a	O
comparatively	O
small	O
force	O
of	O
disciplined	O
troops	,
acting	O
on	O
the	O
defensive	,
with	O
the	O
aid	O
of	O

is	O
able	O
to	O
impede	,
and	O
finally	O
to	O

the	O

one	O
much	O
more	O

the	O
history	O
of	O
war	,
in	O
that	O
quarter	O
of	O
the	O

is	O
no	O
longer	O
a	O
history	O
of	O

of	O

nothing	;
of	O

<bos>	O
in	O
this	O

the	O
scene	O

be	O

the	O

the	O
want	O
of	O
fortifications	,
leaving	O
the	O
frontiers	O
of	O
one	O
state	O

this	O

it	O

even	O
the	O

of	O

to	O
its	O

the	O
violent	O
destruction	O
of	O

the	O
continual	O
effort	O
and	O
alarm	O
attendant	O
on	O
a	O
state	O
of	O

will	O

to	O
resort	O
for	O
repose	O

to	O

to	O
put	O
themselves	O
upon	O
an	O
equality	O
with	O
their	O
more	O

neighbors	.
they	O
would	O
endeavor	O
to	O

by	O

they	O
would	,
at	O
the	O

time	,
be	O
necessitated	O
to	O
strengthen	O
the	O
executive	O
arm	O
of	O
government	,
in	O
doing	O
which	O
their	O
constitutions	O
would	O
acquire	O
a	O
progressive	O
direction	O

it	O
is	O
of	O
the	O
nature	O

<bos>	O
the	O
expedients	O
which	O
have	O

would	O
soon	O
give	O

a	O

strength	,
under	O

and	O
with	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O

have	O
often	O
triumphed	O
over	O
large	O
states	,
or	O
states	O
of	O
greater	O

strength	,
which	O
have	O
been	O

neither	O
the	O
pride	O
nor	O
the	O
safety	O
of	O
the	O
more	O
important	O
states	O
or	O
confederacies	O
would	O
permit	O
them	O
long	O
to	O
submit	O
to	O
this	O
mortifying	O
and	O
adventitious	O
superiority	.
they	O
would	O
quickly	O
resort	O
to	O
means	O
similar	O
to	O
those	O
by	O
which	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
effected	,
to	O
reinstate	O
themselves	O
in	O
their	O

thus	,
we	O
should	,
in	O
a	O
little	O
time	,
see	O
established	O
in	O
every	O
part	O
of	O
this	O
country	O
the	O

engines	O
of	O
despotism	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
scourge	O
of	O
the	O
old	O
world	.
this	,
at	O
least	,
would	O
be	O
the	O
natural	O
course	O
of	O
things	;
and	O
our	O
reasonings	O
will	O
be	O
the	O
more	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
just	,
in	O
proportion	O
as	O
they	O
are	O
accommodated	O
to	O

<bos>	O
these	O
are	O
not	O
vague	O
inferences	O
drawn	O
from	O
supposed	O

defects	O
in	O
a	O

lodged	O
in	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
a	O
people	,

they	O

<bos>	O
it	O
may	,
perhaps	,
be	O
asked	,
by	O
way	O
of	O
objection	O
to	O
this	,
why	O
did	O
not	O

up	O
out	O

there	O

execution	;
and	O
a	O
government	O
ill	O

whatever	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
in	O

must	O
be	,
in	O

a	O

<bos>	O
taking	O
it	O
for	O
granted	,
therefore	,
that	O
all	O
men	O
of	O
sense	O
will	O
agree	O
in	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
an	O
energetic	O
executive	,
it	O
will	O
only	O
remain	O
to	O
inquire	,
what	O
are	O
the	O
ingredients	O
which	O
constitute	O
this	O
energy	?
how	O
far	O
can	O
they	O
be	O
combined	O
with	O
those	O
other	O
ingredients	O
which	O
constitute	O
safety	O
in	O
the	O
republican	O
sense	?
and	O
how	O
far	O
does	O
this	O
combination	O
characterize	O
the	O
plan	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
reported	O
by	O
the	O
convention	?

<bos>	O
the	O
ingredients	O
which	O
constitute	O
energy	O
in	O
the	O
executive	O
are	,
first	,
unity	;
secondly	,
duration	;
thirdly	,
an	O
adequate	O
provision	O
for	O
its	O
support	;
fourthly	,
competent	O
powers	.

<bos>	O
the	O
ingredients	O
which	O
constitute	O
safety	O
in	O
the	O
repub	O
lican	O
sense	O
are	,
first	,
a	O
due	O
dependence	O
on	O
the	O
people	,
secondly	,
a	O
due	O
responsibility	.

<bos>	O
those	O
politicians	O

statesmen	O
who	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
most	O
celebrated	O
for	O
the	O
soundness	O
of	O
their	O
principles	O
and	O
for	O
the	O
justice	O
of	O
their	O
views	,
have	O
declared	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
a	O
single	O
executive	O
and	O
a	O
numerous	O
legislature	.
they	O
have	O
with	O
great	O
propriety	,
considered	O
energy	O
as	O
the	O
most	O
necessary	O
qualification	O
of	O
the	O
former	,
and	O
have	O
regarded	O
this	O
as	O
most	O
applicable	O
to	O
power	O
in	O
a	O
single	O
hand	,
while	O
they	O
have	,
with	O
equal	O
propriety	,
considered	O
the	O
latter	O
as	O
best	O
adapted	O
to	O
deliberation	O
and	O
wisdom	,
and	O
best	O
calculated	O
to	O
conciliate	O
the	O
confidence	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
to	O
secure	O
their	O
privileges	O
and	O
interests	.

<bos>	O
that	O
unity	O
is	O
conducive	O
to	O
energy	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
disputed	.
decision	,
activity	,
secrecy	,
and	O
despatch	O
will	O
generally	O
characterize	O
the	O
proceedings	O
of	O
one	O
man	O
in	O
a	O
much	O
more	O
eminent	O
degree	O
than	O
the	O
proceedings	O
of	O
any	O
greater	O
number	;
and	O
in	O
proportion	O
as	O
the	O
number	O
is	O
increased	,
these	O
qualities	O
will	O
be	O
diminished	.

<bos>	O
this	O
unity	O
may	O
be	O
destroyed	O
in	O
two	O
ways	:
either	O
by	O
vesting	O
the	O
power	O
in	O
two	O
or	O
more	O
magistrates	O
of	O
equal	O
dignity	O
and	O

ostensibly	O
in	O
one	O

both	O
these	O
methods	O
of	O
destroying	O
the	O
unity	O
of	O
the	O

have	O
their	O
partisans	;

the	O
votaries	O
of	O

are	O
the	O

they	O
are	O
both	O

that	O

the	O

<bos>	O
men	O

a	O

merely	O
because	O

in	O

it	O

maxim	O
which	O

obtained	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
the	O
pub	O

that	O
he	O

for	O

nothing	,

can	O

wiser	O
in	O

than	O
to	O
annex	O
to	O
the	O
king	O
a	O
constitutional	O

would	O

in	O

an	O
idea	O
inadmissible	O
in	O
a	O

but	O
even	O
there	O
the	O
king	O
is	O
not	O
bound	O
by	O
the	O
resolutions	O
of	O
his	O
council	,
though	O
they	O
are	O
answerable	O
for	O
the	O

discretion	.

<bos>	O
but	O
in	O
a	O
republic	,
where	O
every	O
magistrate	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
personally	O
responsible	O
for	O
his	O
behavior	O
in	O
office	O
the	O
reason	O
which	O
in	O
the	O

the	O
propriety	O
of	O
a	O
council	,
not	O
only	O
ceases	O
to	O

but	O
turns	O
against	O
the	O
institution	.
in	O
the	O
monarchy	O
of	O
great	O
britain	,
it	O
furnishes	O
a	O
substitute	O
for	O
the	O
prohibited	O
responsibility	O
of	O
the	O
chief	O
magistrate	,
which	O
serves	O
in	O
some	O
degree	O
as	O
a	O
hostage	O
to	O
the	O
national	O
justice	O
for	O
his	O
good	O
behavior	.
in	O
the	O
american	O
republic	,
it	O
would	O
serve	O
to	O
destroy	,
or	O
would	O
greatly	O
diminish	,
the	O
intended	O
and	O
necessary	O
responsibility	O
of	O
the	O
chief	O
magistrate	O
himself	.

<bos>	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
a	O
council	O
to	O
the	O
executive	,
which	O
has	O
so	O
generally	O
obtained	O
in	O
the	O
state	O
constitutions	,
has	O
been	O
derived	O
from	O
that	O
maxim	O
of	O
republican	O
jealousy	O
which	O
considers	O
power	O
as	O
safer	O
in	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
men	O
than	O
of	O
a	O
single	O
man	.
if	O
the	O
maxim	O
should	O
be	O
admitted	O
to	O
be	O
applicable	O
to	O
the	O
case	,
i	O
should	O
contend	O
that	O
the	O
advantage	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
would	O
not	O
counterbalance	O
the	O
numerous	O
disadvantages	O
on	O
the	O
opposite	O
side	.
but	O
i	O
do	O
not	O
think	O
the	O
rule	O
at	O
all	O
applicable	O
to	O
the	O
executive	O
power	.
i	O
clearly	O
concur	O
in	O
opinion	,
in	O
this	O
particular	,
with	O
a	O
writer	O
whom	O
the	O
celebrated	O
junius	O
pronounces	O
to	O
be	O
``	O
deep	,
solid	,
and	O
ingenious	,
''	O
that	O
``	O
the	O
executive	O
power	O
is	O
more	O
easily	O
confined	O
when	O
it	O
is	O
one	O
''	;
2	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
far	O
more	O
safe	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
a	O
single	O
object	O
for	O
the	O
jealousy	O
and	O
watchfulness	O
of	O
the	O
people	;
and	,
in	O
a	O
word	,
that	O
all	O
multiplication	O
of	O
the	O
executive	O
is	O
rather	O
dangerous	O
than	O
friendly	O
to	O
liberty	.

<bos>	O
a	O
little	O
consideration	O
will	O
satisfy	O
us	,
that	O
the	O
species	O
of	O
security	O
sought	O
for	O
in	O
the	O
multiplication	O
of	O
the	O
executive	,
is	O
nattainable	.
numbers	O
must	O
be	O
so	O
great	O
as	O
to	O
render	O
combination	O
difficult	,
or	O
they	O
are	O
rather	O
a	O
source	O
of	O
danger	O
than	O
of	O
security	.
the	O
united	O
credit	O
and	O
influence	O
of	O
several	O
individuals	O
must	O
be	O
more	O
formidable	O
to	O
liberty	,
than	O
the	O
credit	O
and	O
influence	O
of	O
either	O
of	O
them	O
separately	.
when	O
power	,
therefore	,
is	O
placed	O
in	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
so	O
small	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
men	,
as	O
to	O
admit	O
of	O
their	O
interests	O
and	O
views	O
being	O
easily	O
combined	O
in	O
a	O
common	O
enterprise	,
by	O
an	O
artful	O
leader	,
it	O
becomes	O
more	O
liable	O
to	O
abuse	,
and	O
more	O
dangerous	O
when	O
abused	,
than	O
if	O
it	O
be	O
lodged	O
in	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
one	O
man	;
who	,
from	O
the	O
very	O
circumstance	O
of	O
his	O
being	O
alone	,
will	O
be	O
more	O
narrowly	O
watched	O
and	O
more	O
readily	O
suspected	,
and	O
who	O
can	O
not	O
unite	O
so	O
great	O

<bos>	O
a	O
review	O
of	O
the	O
principal	O
objections	O
that	O
have	O
appeared	O
against	O
the	O
proposed	O
court	O
for	O
the	O
trial	O
of	O
impeachments	,
will	O
not	O
improbably	O
eradicate	O
the	O
remains	O
of	O
any	O
unfavorable	O
impressions	O
which	O
may	O
still	O
exist	O
in	O
regard	O
to	O
this	O
matter	.

<bos>	O
the	O
first	O
of	O
these	O
objections	O
is	,
that	O
the	O
provision	O
in	O
question	O
confounds	O
legislative	O
and	O
judiciary	O
authorities	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
body	,
in	O
violation	O
of	O
that	O
important	O
and	O
wellestablished	O
maxim	O
which	O
requires	O
a	O
separation	O
between	O
the	O
different	O
departments	O
of	O
power	.
the	O
true	O
meaning	O
of	O
this	O
maxim	O
has	O
been	O
discussed	O
and	O
ascertained	O
in	O
another	O
place	,
and	O
has	O
been	O
shown	O
to	O
be	O
entirely	O
compatible	O
with	O
a	O
partial	O
intermixture	O
of	O
those	O
departments	O
for	O
special	O
purposes	,
preserving	O
them	,
in	O
the	O
main	,
distinct	O
and	O
unconnected	.
this	O
partial	O
intermixture	O
is	O
even	,
in	O
some	O
cases	,
not	O
only	O
proper	O
but	O
necessary	O
to	O
the	O
mutual	O
defense	O
of	O
the	O
several	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
against	O
each	O
other	.
an	O
absolute	O
or	O
qualified	O
negative	O
in	O
the	O

the	O
acts	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
body	,
is	O
admitted	,
by	O
the	O
ablest	O
adepts	O
in	O
political	O
science	,
to	O
be	O
an	O
indispensable	O
barrier	O
against	O
the	O
encroachments	O
of	O
the	O
latter	O
upon	O
the	O
former	.
and	O
it	O
may	,
perhaps	,
with	O
no	O
less	O
reason	O
be	O
contended	,
that	O
the	O
powers	O
relating	O
to	O
impeachments	O
are	,
as	O
before	O
intimated	,
an	O
essential	O
check	O
in	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
that	O
body	O
upon	O
the	O
encroachments	O
of	O
the	O
executive	.
the	O
division	O
of	O
them	O
between	O
the	O
two	O
branches	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	,
assigning	O
to	O
one	O
the	O
right	O
of	O
accusing	,
to	O
the	O
other	O
the	O
right	O
of	O
judging	,
avoids	O
the	O
inconvenience	O
of	O
making	O
the	O
same	O
persons	O
both	O
accusers	O
and	O
judges	;
and	O
guards	O
against	O
the	O
danger	O
of	O
persecution	,
from	O
the	O
prevalency	O
of	O
a	O
factious	O
spirit	O
in	O
either	O
of	O
those	O
branches	.
as	O
the	O
concurrence	O
of	O
two	O
thirds	O
of	O
the	O
senate	O
will	O
be	O
requisite	O
to	O
a	O
condemnation	,
the	O
security	O
to	O
innocence	,
from	O
this	O
additional	O
circumstance	,
will	O
be	O
as	O
complete	O
as	O
itself	O
can	O
desire	.

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O
curious	O
to	O
observe	,
with	O
what	O
vehemence	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
plan	O
is	O
assailed	,
on	O
the	O
principle	O

inconsiderable	,
that	O
the	O
judiciary	O
authority	O
of	O
new	O
york	,
in	O
the	O
last	O
resort	,
may	,
with	O
truth	,
be	O
said	O
to	O
reside	O
in	O
its	O
senate	.
if	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	O
be	,
in	O
this	O
respect	,
chargeable	O
with	O
a	O
departure	O
from	O
the	O
celebrated	O
maxim	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
so	O
often	O
mentioned	,

seems	O
to	O

<bos>	O
a	O
second	O
objection	O
to	O
the	O
senate	,
as	O
a	O
court	O
of	O
impeachments	,
is	,
that	O
it	O
contributes	O
to	O
an	O
undue	O
accumulation	O
of	O
power	O
in	O
that	O
body	,
tending	O
to	O
give	O
to	O
the	O
government	O
a	O
countenance	O
too	O
aristocratic	.
the	O
senate	,
it	O
is	O
observed	,
is	O
to	O
have	O
concurrent	O
authority	O
with	O
the	O
executive	O
in	O
the	O
formation	O
of	O
treaties	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
appointment	O
to	O
offices	:
if	,
say	O
the	O
objectors	,
to	O
these	O
prerogatives	O
is	O
added	O
that	O
of	O
deciding	O
in	O
all	O
cases	O
of	O
impeachment	,
it	O
will	O
give	O
a	O
decided	O
predominancy	O
to	O
senatorial	O
influence	.
to	O
an	O
objection	O
so	O
little	O
precise	O
in	O
itself	,
it	O
is	O
not	O
easy	O
to	O
find	O
a	O
very	O
precise	O
answer	.
where	O
is	O
the	O
measure	O
or	O
criterion	O
to	O
which	O
we	O
can	O
appeal	,
for	O
determining	O
what	O
will	O
give	O
the	O
senate	O
too	O
much	,
too	O
little	,
or	O
barely	O
the	O
proper	O
degree	O
of	O
influence	?
will	O
it	O
not	O
be	O
more	O
safe	,
as	O
well	O
as	O
more	O
simple	,
to	O
dismiss	O
such	O
vague	O
and	O
uncertain	O
calculations	,
to	O
examine	O
each	O
power	O
by	O
itself	,
and	O
to	O
decide	,
on	O
general	O
principles	,
where	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
deposited	O
with	O
most	O
advantage	O
and	O
least	O
inconvenience	?

<bos>	O
if	O
we	O
take	O
this	O
course	,
it	O
will	O
lead	O
to	O
a	O
more	O
intelligible	,

not	O
to	O
a	O
more	O
certain	O
result	.
the	O
disposition	O
of	O

power	O

in	O
a	O
light	O
not	O

satisfactory	,
in	O

under	O
the	O

head	.
and	O
i	O
flatter	O
myself	O
the	O
observations	O
in	O
my	O
last	O
paper	O
must	O
have	O
gone	O
no	O
inconsiderable	O
way	O
towards	O
proving	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
easy	,
if	O
practicable	,
to	O
find	O
a	O
more	O
fit	O
receptacle	O
for	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
determining	O
impeachments	,
than	O
that	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
chosen	.
if	O
this	O
be	O
truly	O
the	O
case	,
the	O
hypothetical	O
dread	O
of	O
the	O
too	O
great	O
weight	O
of	O
the	O
senate	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
discarded	O
from	O
our	O
reasonings	.

<bos>	O
but	O
this	O
hypothesis	,
such	O
as	O
it	O
is	,
has	O
already	O
been	O
refuted	O
in	O
the	O
remarks	O
applied	O
to	O
the	O
duration	O
in	O
office	O
prescribed	O
for	O
the	O
senators	.
it	O
was	O
by	O
them	O
shown	,
as	O
well	O
on	O
the	O
credit	O
of	O
historical	O
examples	,
as	O
from	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
the	O
thing	,
that	O
the	O
most	O
popular	O
branch	O
of	O
every	O
government	,
partaking	O
of	O
the	O
republican	O
genius	,
by	O
being	O
generally	O
the	O
favorite	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
will	O
be	O

a	O

and	O

principle	,
to	O

equilibrium	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
house	O
of	O

of	O

of	O

most	O

citizens	O
of	O

for	O
the	O
first	O
office	O
in	O
it	.
it	O
would	O
not	O
perhaps	O
be	O
rash	O
to	O
predict	,
that	O
as	O
a	O
mean	O
of	O

it	O
will	O
be	O
found	O
to	O
outweigh	O
all	O
the	O
peculiar	O
attributes	O
of	O

senate	.

<bos>	O
a	O
third	O
objection	O
to	O
the	O
senate	O
as	O
a	O
court	O
of	O
impeachments	,
is	O
drawn	O
from	O
the	O
agency	O
they	O
are	O
to	O
have	O
in	O
the	O
appointments	O
to	O
office	.
it	O
is	O
imagined	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
too	O
indulgent	O
judges	O
of	O
the	O
conduct	O
of	O
men	,
in	O
whose	O
official	O
creation	O
they	O
had	O
participated	.
the	O
principle	O
of	O
this	O
objection	O
would	O
condemn	O
a	O
practice	,
which	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
state	O
governments	,
if	O
not	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
governments	O
with	O
which	O
we	O
are	O
acquainted	:
i	O
mean	O
that	O
of	O
rendering	O
those	O
who	O
hold	O
offices	O
during	O
pleasure	,
dependent	O
on	O
the	O
pleasure	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
appoint	O
them	.
with	O
equal	O
plausibility	O
might	O
it	O
be	O
alleged	O
in	O
this	O
case	,
that	O
the	O
favoritism	O
of	O
the	O
latter	O
would	O
always	O
be	O
an	O
asylum	O
for	O
the	O
misbehavior	O
of	O
the	O
former	.
but	O
that	O
practice	,
in	O
contradiction	O
to	O
this	O
principle	,
proceeds	O
upon	O
the	O
presumption	,
that	O
the	O
responsibility	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
appoint	,
for	O
the	O
fitness	O
and	O
competency	O
of	O
the	O
persons	O
on	O
whom	O
they	O
bestow	O
their	O
choice	,
and	O
the	O
interest	O
they	O
will	O
have	O
in	O
the	O
respectable	O
and	O
prosperous	O
administration	O
of	O
affairs	,
will	O
inspire	O
a	O
sufficient	O
disposition	O
to	O
dismiss	O
from	O
a	O
share	O
in	O
it	O
all	O
such	O
who	,
by	O
their	O
conduct	,
shall	O
have	O
proved	O
themselves	O
unworthy	O
of	O
the	O
confidence	O
reposed	O
in	O
them	.
though	O
facts	O
may	O
not	O
always	O
correspond	O
with	O
this	O
presumption	,
yet	O
if	O
it	O
be	,
in	O
the	O
main	,
just	,
it	O
must	O
destroy	O
the	O
supposition	O
that	O
the	O
senate	,
who	O
will	O
merely	O
sanction	O
the	O
choice	O
of	O
the	O
executive	,
should	O
feel	O
a	O
bias	,
towards	O
the	O
objects	O
of	O
that	O
choice	,
strong	O
enough	O
to	O
blind	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
evidences	O
of	O
guilt	O
so	O
extraordinary	,
as	O
to	O
have	O
induced	O
the	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
nation	O
to	O
become	O
its	O
accusers	.

<bos>	O
if	O
any	O
further	O
arguments	O
were	O
necessary	O
to	O
evince	O
the	O
improbability	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
bias	,
it	O
might	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
agency	O
of	O
the	O
senate	O
in	O
the	O
business	O
of	O
appointments	.

<bos>	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
the	O
office	O
of	O
the	O
president	O
to	O
nominate	,
and	,
with	O
the	O
advice	O
and	O
consent	O
of	O
the	O
senate	,
to	O
appoint	.
there	O
will	,
of	O
course	,
be	O
no	O
exertion	O
of	O
choice	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
senate	.
they	O
may	O
defeat	O
one	O
choice	O
of	O
the	O
executive	,
and	O
oblige	O
him	O
to	O
make	O
another	;
but	O
they	O
can	O
not	O
themselves	O
choose	,
they	O
can	O
only	O
ratify	O
or	O
reject	O
the	O
choice	O
of	O
the	O
president	.
they	O
might	O
even	O
entertain	O
a	O
preference	O
to	O
some	O
other	O
person	,
at	O
the	O
very	O
moment	O
they	O
were	O
assenting	O
to	O
the	O
one	O
proposed	,
because	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
no	O
positive	O
ground	O
of	O
opposition	O
to	O
him	;
and	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
sure	,
if	O
they	O
withheld	O
their	O
assent	,
that	O
the	O
subsequent	O
nomination	O
would	O
fall	O
upon	O
their	O
own	O
favorite	,
or	O
upon	O
any	O
other	O
person	O
in	O
their	O
estimation	O
more	O
meritorious	O
than	O
the	O
one	O
rejected	.
thus	O
it	O
could	O
hardly	O
happen	,
that	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
senate	O
would	O
feel	O
any	O
other	O
complacency	O
towards	O
the	O
object	O
of	O
an	O
appointment	O
than	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
appearances	O
of	O
merit	O
might	O
inspire	,
and	O
the	O
proofs	O
of	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
it	O
destroy	.

<bos>	O
a	O
fourth	O
objection	O
to	O
the	O
senate	O
in	O
the	O
capacity	O
of	O
a	O
court	O
of	O
impeachments	,
is	O
derived	O
from	O
its	O
union	O
with	O
the	O
executive	O
in	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
making	O
treaties	.
this	,
it	O
has	O
been	O
said	,
would	O
constitute	O
the	O
senators	O
their	O
own	O
judges	,
in	O
every	O
case	O
of	O
a	O
corrupt	O
or	O
perfidious	O
execution	O
of	O
that	O
trust	.
after	O
having	O
combined	O
with	O
the	O
executive	O
in	O
betraying	O
the	O
interests	O
of	O
the	O
nation	O
in	O
a	O
ruinous	O
treaty	,
what	O
prospect	,
it	O
is	O
asked	,
would	O
there	O
be	O
of	O
their	O
being	O
made	O
to	O
suffer	O
the	O
punishment	O
they	O
would	O
deserve	,
when	O
they	O
were	O
themselves	O
to	O
decide	O
upon	O
the	O
accusation	O
brought	O
against	O
them	O
for	O
the	O
treachery	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
have	O
been	O
guilty	?

<bos>	O
this	O
objection	O
has	O
been	O
circulated	O
with	O
more	O
earnestness	O
and	O
with	O
greater	O
show	O
of	O
reason	O
than	O
any	O
other	O
which	O
has	O
appeared	O
against	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
plan	;
and	O
yet	O
i	O
am	O
deceived	O
if	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
rest	O
upon	O
an	O
erroneous	O
foundation	.

<bos>	O
the	O

punishment	O
of	O
the	O

for	O
a	O
deviation	O

want	O
of	O

in	O

committed	O

might	O
also	O
have	O
had	O
in	O
view	O
the	O
punishment	O
of	O
a	O
few	O
leading	O
individuals	O
in	O
the	O
senate	,
who	O
should	O

the	O

instruments	O

corruption	:
but	O
they	O
could	O
not	,
with	O
more	O
or	O
with	O
equal	O
propriety	,
have	O
contemplated	O
the	O
impeachment	O
and	O
punishment	O
of	O
two	O

of	O
the	O

to	O

principle	O
which	,
i	O
believe	,
has	O
never	O

how	,
in	O
fact	,
could	O
a	O
majority	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	O
impeach	O
themselves	?
not	O
better	,
it	O
is	O
evident	,
than	O
two	O
thirds	O
of	O
the	O
senate	O
might	O
try	O
themselves	.
and	O
yet	O
what	O
reason	O
is	O
there	,
that	O
a	O

of	O
the	O

the	O
interests	O
of	O
the	O

by	O
an	O
unjust	O

independence	O
of	O
the	O
deliberations	O
of	O
the	O
body	,
that	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
exempt	O
from	O
punishment	O
for	O
acts	O
done	O
in	O
a	O
collective	O
capacity	;
and	O
the	O
security	O
to	O
the	O
society	O
must	O
depend	O
on	O
the	O
care	O
which	O
is	O
taken	O
to	O
confide	O
the	O
trust	O
to	O
proper	O
hands	,
to	O
make	O
it	O
their	O
interest	O
to	O
execute	O
it	O
with	O
fidelity	,
and	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
as	O
difficult	O
as	O
possible	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
combine	O
in	O
any	O
interest	O
opposite	O
to	O
that	O
of	O

<bos>	O
so	O
far	O
as	O
might	O
concern	O
the	O
misbehavior	O
of	O
the	O
executive	O
in	O
perverting	O
the	O
instructions	O
or	O
contravening	O
the	O
views	O
of	O
the	O
senate	,
we	O
need	O
not	O
be	O
apprehensive	O
of	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
a	O
disposition	O
in	O
that	O
body	O
to	O
punish	O
the	O
abuse	O
of	O
their	O
confidence	O
or	O
to	O
vindicate	O
their	O
own	O
authority	.
we	O
may	O
thus	O
far	O
count	O
upon	O
their	O
pride	,
if	O
not	O
upon	O
their	O
virtue	.
and	O
so	O
far	O
even	O
as	O
might	O
concern	O
the	O
corruption	O
of	O
leading	O
members	,
by	O
whose	O
arts	O
and	O
influence	O
the	O
majority	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
inveigled	O
into	O
measures	O
odious	O
to	O
the	O
community	,
if	O
the	O
proofs	O
of	O
that	O
corruption	O
should	O
be	O
satisfactory	,
the	O
usual	O
propensity	O
of	O
human	O
nature	O
will	O
warrant	O
us	O
in	O
concluding	O
that	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
commonly	O
no	O
defect	O
of	O
inclination	O
in	O
the	O
body	O
to	O
divert	O
the	O
public	O
resentment	O
from	O
themselves	O
by	O
a	O
ready	O
sacrifice	O
of	O

<bos>	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
new	O
york	:

<bos>	O
we	O
proceed	O
now	O
to	O
an	O
examination	O
of	O
the	O
judiciary	O
department	O
of	O
the	O
proposed	O
government	.

<bos>	O
in	O
unfolding	O
the	O
defects	O
of	O
the	O
existing	O
confederation	,
the	O
utility	O
and	O
necessity	O
of	O
a	O
federal	O
judicature	O
have	O
been	O
clearly	O
pointed	O
out	.
it	O
is	O
the	O
less	O
necessary	O
to	O
recapitulate	O
the	O
considerations	O
there	O
urged	,
as	O
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
the	O
institution	O
in	O
the	O
abstract	O
is	O
not	O
disputed	;
the	O
only	O
questions	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
raised	O
being	O
relative	O
to	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
constituting	O
it	,
and	O
to	O
its	O
extent	.
to	O
these	O
points	,
therefore	,
our	O
observations	O
shall	O
be	O
confined	.

<bos>	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
constituting	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
embrace	O
these	O
several	O
objects	:
1st	.
the	O
mode	O
of	O
appointing	O
the	O
judges	.
2d	.
the	O
tenure	O
by	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
to	O
hold	O
their	O
places	.
3d	.
the	O
partition	O
of	O
the	O
judiciary	O
authority	O
between	O
different	O
courts	,
and	O
their	O
relations	O
to	O
each	O
other	.

<bos>	O
first	.
as	O
to	O
the	O
mode	O
of	O
appointing	O
the	O
judges	;
this	O
is	O
the	O
same	O
with	O
that	O
of	O
appointing	O
the	O
officers	O
of	O
the	O
union	O
in	O
general	,
and	O
has	O
been	O
so	O
fully	O
discussed	O
in	O
the	O
two	O
last	O
numbers	,
that	O
nothing	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
here	O
which	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
useless	O
repetition	.

<bos>	O
second	.
as	O
to	O
the	O
tenure	O
by	O
which	O
the	O
judges	O
are	O
to	O
hold	O
their	O
places	;
this	O
chiefly	O
concerns	O
their	O
duration	O
in	O
office	;
the	O
provisions	O
for	O
their	O
support	;
the	O
precautions	O
for	O
their	O
responsibility	.

<bos>	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	,
all	O
judges	O
who	O
may	O
be	O
appointed	O
by	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
are	O
to	O
hold	O
their	O
offices	O
during	O
good	O
behavior	;
which	O
is	O
conformable	O
to	O
the	O
most	O
approved	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
constitutions	O
and	O
among	O
the	O
rest	,
to	O
that	O
of	O
this	O
state	.
its	O
propriety	O
having	O
been	O
drawn	O
into	O
question	O
by	O
the	O
adversaries	O
of	O
that	O
plan	,
is	O
no	O
light	O
symptom	O
of	O
the	O
rage	O
for	O
objection	,
which	O
disorders	O
their	O
imaginations	O
and	O
judgments	.
the	O
standard	O
of	O
good	O
behavior	O
for	O
the	O
continuance	O
in	O
office	O
of	O
the	O
judicial	O
magistracy	,
is	O
certainly	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
valuable	O
of	O
the	O
modern	O
improvements	O
in	O
the	O
practice	O
of	O
government	.
in	O
a	O
monarchy	O
it	O
is	O
an	O
excellent	O
barrier	O
to	O
the	O
despotism	O
of	O
the	O
prince	;
in	O
a	O
republic	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
no	O
less	O
excellent	O
barrier	O
to	O
the	O
encroachments	O
and	O
oppressions	O
of	O
the	O
representative	O
body	.
and	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
expedient	O
which	O
can	O
be	O
devised	O
in	O
any	O
government	,
to	O
secure	O
a	O
steady	,
upright	,
and	O
impartial	O
administration	O
of	O
the	O
laws	.

<bos>	O
whoever	O
attentively	O
considers	O
the	O
different	O
departments	O
of	O
power	O
must	O
perceive	,
that	,
in	O
a	O
government	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
separated	O
from	O
each	O
other	,
the	O
judiciary	,
from	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
its	O
functions	,
will	O
always	O
be	O
the	O
least	O
dangerous	O
to	O
the	O
political	O
rights	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	;
because	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
least	O
in	O
a	O
capacity	O
to	O
annoy	O
or	O
injure	O
them	.
the	O
executive	O
not	O
only	O
dispenses	O
the	O
honors	,
but	O
holds	O
the	O
sword	O
of	O
the	O
community	.
the	O
legislature	O
not	O
only	O
commands	O
the	O
purse	,
but	O
prescribes	O
the	O
rules	O
by	O
which	O
the	O
duties	O
and	O
rights	O
of	O
every	O
citizen	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
regulated	.
the	O
judiciary	,
on	O
the	O
contrary	,
has	O
no	O
influence	O
over	O
either	O
the	O
sword	O
or	O
the	O
purse	;
no	O
direction	O
either	O
of	O
the	O
strength	O
or	O
of	O
the	O
wealth	O
of	O
the	O
society	;
and	O
can	O
take	O
no	O
active	O
resolution	O
whatever	.
it	O
may	O
truly	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
have	O
neither	O
force	O
nor	O
will	,
but	O
merely	O
judgment	;
and	O
must	O
ultimately	O
depend	O
upon	O
the	O
aid	O
of	O
the	O
executive	O
arm	O
even	O
for	O
the	O
efficacy	O
of	O
its	O
judgments	.

<bos>	O
this	O
simple	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
matter	O
suggests	O
several	O
important	O
consequences	.
it	O
proves	O
incontestably	,
that	O
the	O
judiciary	O
is	O
beyond	O
comparison	O
the	O
weakest	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
departments	O
of	O
power1	;
that	O
it	O
can	O
never	O
attack	O
with	O
success	O
either	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
two	;
and	O
that	O
all	O
possible	O
care	O
is	O
requisite	O
to	O
enable	O
it	O
to	O
defend	O
itself	O
against	O
their	O
attacks	.
it	O
equally	O
proves	,
that	O
though	O
individual	O
oppression	O
may	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
proceed	O
from	O
the	O
courts	O
of	O
justice	,
the	O
general	O
liberty	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
can	O
never	O
be	O
endangered	O
from	O
that	O
quarter	;
i	O
mean	O
so	O
long	O
as	O
the	O
judiciary	O
remains	O
truly	O
distinct	O
from	O
both	O
the	O
legislature	O
and	O
the	O
executive	.
for	O
i	O
agree	,
that	O
``	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
liberty	,
if	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
judging	O
be	O
not	O
separated	O
from	O
the	O
legislative	O
and	O
executive	O
powers	.
``	O
2	O
and	O
it	O
proves	,
in	O
the	O
last	O
place	,
that	O
as	O
liberty	O
can	O
have	O
nothing	O
to	O
fear	O
from	O
the	O
judiciary	O
alone	,
but	O
would	O
have	O
every	O
thing	O
to	O
fear	O
from	O
its	O
union	O
with	O
either	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
departments	;
that	O
as	O
all	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
union	O
must	O
ensue	O
from	O
a	O
dependence	O
of	O
the	O
former	O
on	O
the	O
latter	,
notwithstanding	O
a	O
nominal	O
and	O
apparent	O
separation	;
that	O
as	,
from	O
the	O
natural	O
feebleness	O
of	O
the	O
judiciary	,
it	O
is	O
in	O
continual	O
jeopardy	O
of	O
being	O
overpowered	,
awed	,
or	O
influenced	O
by	O
its	O
co-ordinate	O
branches	;
and	O
that	O
as	O
nothing	O
can	O
contribute	O
so	O
much	O
to	O
its	O
firmness	O
and	O
independence	O
as	O
permanency	O
in	O
office	,
this	O
quality	O
may	O
therefore	O
be	O
justly	O
regarded	O
as	O
an	O
indispensable	O
ingredient	O
in	O
its	O
constitution	,
and	,
in	O
a	O
great	O
measure	,
as	O
the	O
citadel	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
justice	O
and	O
the	O
public	O
security	.

<bos>	O
the	O
complete	O
independence	O
of	O
the	O
courts	O
of	O
justice	O
is	O
peculiarly	O
essential	O
in	O
a	O
limited	O
constitution	.
by	O
a	O
limited	O
constitution	,
i	O
understand	O
one	O
which	O
contains	O
certain	O
specified	O
exceptions	O
to	O
the	O
legislative	O
authority	;
such	,
for	O
instance	,
as	O
that	O
it	O
shall	O
pass	O
no	O
bills	O
of	O
attainder	,
no	O
ex-post-facto	O
laws	,
and	O
the	O
like	.
limitations	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
can	O
be	O
preserved	O
in	O
practice	O
no	O
other	O
way	O
than	O
through	O
the	O
medium	O
of	O
courts	O
of	O
justice	,
whose	O
duty	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
to	O
declare	O
all	O
acts	O
contrary	O
to	O
the	O
manifest	O
tenor	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	O
void	.
without	O
this	,
all	O
the	O
reservations	O
of	O
particular	O
rights	O
or	O
privileges	O
would	O
amount	O
to	O
nothing	.

<bos>	O
some	O
perplexity	O
respecting	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
the	O
courts	O
to	O
pronounce	O
legislative	O
acts	O
void	,
because	O
contrary	O
to	O
the	O
constitution	,
has	O
arisen	O
from	O
an	O
imagination	O
that	O
the	O
doctrine	O
would	O
imply	O
a	O
superiority	O
of	O
the	O
judiciary	O
to	O
the	O
legislative	O
power	.
it	O
is	O
urged	O
that	O
the	O
authority	O
which	O
can	O
declare	O
the	O
acts	O
of	O
another	O
void	,
must	O
necessarily	O
be	O
superior	O
to	O
the	O
one	O
whose	O
acts	O
may	O
be	O
declared	O
void	.
as	O
this	O
doctrine	O
is	O
of	O
great	O
importance	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
american	O
constitutions	,
a	O
brief	O
discussion	O
of	O
the	O
ground	O
on	O
which	O
it	O
rests	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
unacceptable	.

<bos>	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
position	O
which	O
depends	O
on	O
clearer	O
principles	,
than	O
that	O
every	O
act	O
of	O
a	O
delegated	O
authority	,
contrary	O
to	O
the	O
tenor	O
of	O
the	O
commission	O
under	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
exercised	,
is	O
void	.
no	O
legislative	O
act	,
therefore	,
contrary	O
to	O
the	O
constitution	,
can	O
be	O
valid	.
to	O
deny	O
this	,
would	O
be	O
to	O
affirm	,
that	O
the	O
deputy	O
is	O
greater	O
than	O
his	O
principal	;
that	O
the	O
servant	O
is	O
above	O
his	O
master	;
that	O
the	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
are	O
superior	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
themselves	;
that	O
men	O
acting	O
by	O
virtue	O
of	O
powers	,
may	O
do	O
not	O
only	O
what	O
their	O
powers	O
do	O
not	O
authorize	,
but	O
what	O
they	O
forbid	.

<bos>	O
if	O
it	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
legislative	O
body	O
are	O
themselves	O
the	O
constitutional	O
judges	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
powers	,
and	O
that	O
the	O
construction	O
they	O
put	O
upon	O
them	O
is	O
conclusive	O
upon	O
the	O
other	O
departments	,
it	O
may	O
be	O
answered	,
that	O
this	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
the	O
natural	O
presumption	,
where	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
collected	O
from	O
any	O
particular	O
provisions	O
in	O
the	O
constitution	.
it	O
is	O
not	O
otherwise	O
to	O
be	O
supposed	,
that	O
the	O
constitution	O
could	O
intend	O
to	O
enable	O
the	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
to	O
substitute	O
their	O
will	O
to	O
that	O
of	O
their	O
constituents	.
it	O
is	O
far	O
more	O
rational	O
to	O
suppose	,
that	O
the	O
courts	O
were	O
designed	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
intermediate	O
body	O
between	O
the	O
people	O
and	O
the	O
legislature	,
in	O
order	,
among	O
other	O
things	,
to	O
keep	O
the	O
latter	O
within	O
the	O
limits	O
assigned	O
to	O
their	O
authority	.
the	O
interpretation	O
of	O
the	O
laws	O
is	O
the	O
proper	O
and	O
peculiar	O
province	O
of	O
the	O
courts	.
a	O
constitution	O
is	,
in	O
fact	,
and	O
must	O
be	O
regarded	O
by	O
the	O
judges	,
as	O
a	O
fundamental	O
law	.
it	O
therefore	O
belongs	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
ascertain	O
its	O
meaning	,
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
any	O
particular	O
act	O
proceeding	O
from	O
the	O
legislative	O
body	.
if	O
there	O
should	O
happen	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
irreconcilable	O
variance	O
between	O
the	O
two	,
that	O
which	O
has	O
the	O
superior	O
obligation	O
and	O
validity	O
ought	,
of	O
course	,
to	O
be	O
preferred	;
or	,
in	O
other	O
words	,
the	O
constitution	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
preferred	O
to	O
the	O
statute	,
the	O
intention	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
to	O
the	O
intention	O
of	O
their	O
agents	.

<bos>	O
nor	O
does	O
this	O
conclusion	O
by	O
any	O
means	O
suppose	O
a	O
superiority	O
of	O
the	O
judicial	O
to	O
the	O
legislative	O
power	.
it	O
only	O
supposes	O
that	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
is	O
superior	O
to	O
both	;
and	O
that	O
where	O
the	O
will	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	,
declared	O
in	O
its	O
statutes	,
stands	O
in	O
opposition	O
to	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
declared	O
in	O
the	O
constitution	,
the	O
judges	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
governed	O
by	O
the	O
latter	O
rather	O
than	O
the	O
former	.
they	O
ought	O
to	O
regulate	O
their	O
decisions	O
by	O
the	O
fundamental	O

<bos>	O
this	O
exercise	O

discretion	,
in	O
determining	O
between	O
two	O

laws	,
is	O
exemplified	O
in	O
a	O
familiar	O
instance	.
it	O
not	O
uncommonly	O
happens	,
that	O
there	O
are	O
two	O
statutes	O

at	O

in	O
such	O

it	O
is	O
the	O

that	O

it	O

to	O

the	O
rule	O
which	O
has	O
obtained	O
in	O
the	O

for	O

is	,
that	O
the	O

this	O
is	O
a	O
mere	O
rule	O
of	O
construction	,
not	O
derived	O
from	O
any	O
positive	O
law	,
but	O
from	O
the	O
nature	O
and	O

of	O
the	O

it	O
is	O
a	O
rule	O
not	O
enjoined	O
upon	O

by	O
legislative	O
provision	,
but	O
adopted	O
by	O
themselves	,
as	O
consonant	O
to	O
truth	O

for	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
their	O
conduct	O
as	O
interpreters	O
of	O

that	O
which	O
was	O
the	O

in	O

the	O

they	O
teach	O
us	O
that	O
the	O

to	O
be	O
preferred	O
to	O
the	O

that	O
accordingly	,
whenever	O
a	O
particular	O
statute	O
contravenes	O
the	O

it	O
will	O
be	O
the	O
duty	O
of	O
the	O
judicial	O
tribunals	O
to	O
adhere	O
to	O
the	O

<bos>	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
of	O
no	O
weight	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
courts	,
on	O
the	O
pretense	O
of	O
a	O
repugnancy	,
may	O
substitute	O
their	O

this	O
might	O

it	O

as	O

happen	O
in	O
every	O
adjudication	O
upon	O
any	O

statute	.
the	O
courts	O
must	O
declare	O
the	O
sense	O
of	O

if	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
disposed	O
to	O
exercise	O
will	O
instead	O
of	O
judgment	,
the	O
consequence	O
would	O
equally	O
be	O
the	O
substitution	O
of	O
their	O
pleasure	O
to	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O

the	O
observation	,
if	O
it	O

would	O
prove	O
that	O
there	O
ought	O

body	.

<bos>	O
if	,

the	O
courts	O
of	O
justice	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
the	O
bulwarks	O
of	O
a	O
limited	O
constitution	O
against	O
legislative	O
encroachments	,
this	O
consideration	O
will	O
afford	O
a	O
strong	O
argument	O
for	O
the	O
permanent	O
tenure	O
of	O
judicial	O
offices	,
since	O
nothing	O
will	O
contribute	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
this	O
to	O
that	O
independent	O
spirit	O
in	O
the	O

which	O
must	O
be	O
essential	O
to	O
the	O
faithful	O
performance	O
of	O
so	O
arduous	O
a	O
duty	.

<bos>	O
this	O
independence	O
of	O
the	O

is	O
equally	O
requisite	O
to	O
guard	O
the	O
constitution	O

the	O

whenever	O

inconsistent	O
with	O

yet	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
to	O

inferred	O
from	O
this	O
principle	,
that	O
the	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
whenever	O
a	O
momentary	O
inclination	O
happens	O
to	O
lay	O
hold	O
of	O
a	O

of	O
their	O
constituents	,
incompatible	O
with	O
the	O
provisions	O
in	O
the	O

constitution	,
would	,
on	O
that	O
account	,
be	O
justifiable	O
in	O
a	O
violation	O
of	O
those	O
provisions	;
or	O
that	O
the	O
courts	O
would	O
be	O
under	O
a	O
greater	O
obligation	O
to	O
connive	O
at	O
infractions	O
in	O
this	O
shape	,
than	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
proceeded	O
wholly	O
from	O
the	O
cabals	O
of	O
the	O
representative	O
body	.
until	O
the	O
people	O
have	,
by	O
some	O
solemn	O
and	O
authoritative	O
act	,
annulled	O
or	O
changed	O
the	O
established	O
form	,
it	O
is	O
binding	O
upon	O
themselves	O
collectively	,
as	O
well	O
as	O
individually	;
and	O
no	O
presumption	,
or	O
even	O
knowledge	,
of	O
their	O
sentiments	,
can	O
warrant	O
their	O
representatives	O
in	O
a	O
departure	O
from	O
it	,
prior	O
to	O
such	O
an	O
act	.
but	O
it	O
is	O
easy	O
to	O
see	,
that	O
it	O
would	O
require	O
an	O
uncommon	O
portion	O
of	O
fortitude	O
in	O
the	O
judges	O
to	O
do	O
their	O
duty	O
as	O
faithful	O
guardians	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	,
where	O
legislative	O
invasions	O
of	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
instigated	O
by	O
the	O
major	O
voice	O
of	O
the	O

<bos>	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
with	O
a	O
view	O
to	O
infractions	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	O
only	,
that	O
the	O
independence	O
of	O
the	O
judges	O
may	O
be	O
an	O
essential	O
safeguard	O
against	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
occasional	O
ill	O
humors	O
in	O
the	O

these	O

the	O
injury	O
of	O
the	O

rights	O
of	O

here	O
also	O
the	O
firmness	O
of	O
the	O
judicial	O

is	O
of	O
vast	O
importance	O
in	O
mitigating	O
the	O
severity	O
and	O
confining	O
the	O
operation	O
of	O
such	O

it	O
not	O

serves	O
to	O
moderate	O
the	O
immediate	O
mischiefs	O
of	O
those	O
which	O
may	O
have	O
been	O

but	O
it	O
operates	O
as	O
a	O
check	O
upon	O
the	O
legislative	O
body	O
in	O

them	;

of	O
the	O
injustice	O

to	O

this	O
is	O
a	O
circumstance	O
calculated	O
to	O
have	O
more	O

upon	O

every	O
man	O
must	O
now	O
feel	,
that	O
the	O
inevitable	O
tendency	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
spirit	O
is	O
to	O
sap	O
the	O
foundations	O
of	O

to	O

<bos>	O
that	O
inflexible	O

adherence	O
to	O

of	O

which	O

to	O

in	O
the	O

of	O

can	O
certainly	O

be	O
expected	O
from	O

who	O

their	O
offices	O
by	O
a	O

commission	.
periodical	O
appointments	,
however	O
regulated	,
or	O
by	O
whomsoever	O

would	,
in	O
some	O
way	O

be	O
fatal	O
to	O
their	O
necessary	O
independence	.
if	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
making	O
them	O
was	O
committed	O
either	O
to	O
the	O
executive	O
or	O

there	O
would	O
be	O
danger	O
of	O
an	O
improper	O
complaisance	O
to	O
the	O
branch	O
which	O

would	O

an	O
unwillingness	O

to	O
the	O
people	,
or	O
to	O
persons	O
chosen	O

for	O

there	O
would	O
be	O

<bos>	O
there	O
is	O

a	O
further	O
and	O
a	O
weightier	O
reason	O
for	O
the	O
permanency	O
of	O
the	O
judicial	O

which	O
is	O
deducible	O
from	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O

it	O
has	O
been	O
frequently	O
remarked	,
with	O
great	O
propriety	,
that	O
a	O
voluminous	O
code	O
of	O

is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
inconveniences	O
necessarily	O
connected	O
with	O
the	O
advantages	O
of	O
a	O
free	O
government	.
to	O
avoid	O
an	O
arbitrary	O
discretion	O
in	O
the	O
courts	,
it	O
is	O
indispensable	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
bound	O
down	O
by	O
strict	O
rules	O
and	O
precedents	,
which	O
serve	O
to	O
define	O
and	O
point	O
out	O
their	O
duty	O
in	O
every	O
particular	O
case	O
that	O
comes	O
before	O
them	;
and	O
it	O
will	O
readily	O
be	O
conceived	O
from	O
the	O
variety	O
of	O
controversies	O
which	O
grow	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
folly	O
and	O
wickedness	O
of	O
mankind	,
that	O
the	O
records	O
of	O
those	O
precedents	O
must	O
unavoidably	O
swell	O
to	O
a	O
very	O
considerable	O
bulk	,
and	O
must	O
demand	O
long	O
and	O
laborious	O
study	O
to	O
acquire	O
a	O
competent	O
knowledge	O
of	O
them	.
hence	O
it	O
is	,
that	O
there	O
can	O
be	O
but	O
few	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
society	O
who	O
will	O
have	O
sufficient	O
skill	O
in	O
the	O

to	O
qualify	O
them	O
for	O
the	O

the	O
proper	O

for	O
the	O

the	O

the	O

these	O
considerations	O
apprise	O
us	,
that	O

no	O
great	O
option	O
between	O

that	O
a	O

would	O

a	O

line	O
of	O
practice	O
to	O

a	O

the	O

than	O
they	O
may	O
at	O

appear	;

it	O
must	O
be	O
confessed	,
that	O
they	O
are	O

inferior	O
to	O
those	O

<bos>	O
upon	O

there	O
can	O
be	O
no	O
room	O
to	O
doubt	O
that	O
the	O

i	O
shall	O

myself	O
with	O
barely	O
observing	O
here	,
that	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
confederacies	O
of	O
antiquity	,
which	O
history	O
has	O
handed	O
down	O
to	O
us	,
the	O
lycian	O
and	O
achaean	O
leagues	,
as	O
far	O
as	O
there	O
remain	O
vestiges	O
of	O
them	,
appear	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
most	O
free	O
from	O
the	O
fetters	O
of	O
that	O
mistaken	O
principle	,

were	O
accordingly	O
those	O
which	O
have	O
best	O
deserved	,
and	O
have	O
most	O
liberally	O
received	,
the	O
applauding	O
suffrages	O
of	O

writers	.

<bos>	O
this	O
exceptionable	O
principle	O
may	,
as	O
truly	O
as	O
emphatically	,
be	O
styled	O
the	O
parent	O
of	O
anarchy	:
it	O
has	O
been	O
seen	O
that	O
delinquencies	O
in	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
union	O
are	O
its	O
natural	O
and	O
necessary	O
offspring	;
and	O
that	O
whenever	O
they	O
happen	,
the	O
only	O
constitutional	O
remedy	O
is	O
force	,
and	O
the	O
immediate	O
effect	O
of	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
it	,
civil	O
war	.

<bos>	O
it	O
remains	O
to	O
inquire	O
how	O
far	O
so	O
odious	O
an	O
engine	O
of	O
government	,
in	O
its	O
application	O
to	O
us	,
would	O
even	O
be	O
capable	O
of	O
answering	O
its	O
end	.
if	O
there	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
a	O
large	O
army	O
constantly	O
at	O
the	O
disposal	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
government	O
it	O
would	O
either	O
not	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
employ	O
force	O
at	O
all	,
or	,
when	O
this	O
could	O
be	O
done	,
it	O
would	O
amount	O
to	O
a	O
war	O
between	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
confederacy	O
concerning	O
the	O
infractions	O
of	O
a	O
league	,
in	O
which	O
the	O
strongest	O
combination	O
would	O
be	O
most	O
likely	O
to	O
prevail	,
whether	O
it	O
consisted	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
supported	O
or	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
resisted	O
the	O
general	O
authority	.
it	O
would	O
rarely	O
happen	O
that	O
the	O
delinquency	O
to	O
be	O
redressed	O
would	O
be	O
confined	O
to	O
a	O
single	O
member	,
and	O
if	O
there	O
were	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
who	O
had	O
neglected	O
their	O
duty	,
similarity	O
of	O
situation	O
would	O
induce	O
them	O
to	O
unite	O
for	O
common	O
defense	.
independent	O
of	O
this	O
motive	O
of	O
sympathy	,
if	O
a	O
large	O
and	O
influential	O
state	O
should	O
happen	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
aggressing	O
member	,
it	O
would	O
commonly	O
have	O
weight	O
enough	O
with	O
its	O
neighbors	O
to	O
win	O
over	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
associates	O
to	O
its	O
cause	.
specious	O
arguments	O
of	O
danger	O
to	O
the	O
common	O
liberty	O
could	O
easily	O
be	O
contrived	;
plausible	O
excuses	O
for	O
the	O
deficiencies	O
of	O
the	O
party	O
could	,
without	O
difficulty	,
be	O
invented	O
to	O
alarm	O
the	O
apprehensions	,
inflame	O
the	O
passions	,
and	O
conciliate	O
the	O
good-will	,
even	O
of	O
those	O
states	O
which	O
were	O
not	O
chargeable	O
with	O
any	O
violation	O
or	O
omission	O
of	O
duty	.
this	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
more	O
likely	O
to	O
take	O
place	,
as	O
the	O
delinquencies	O
of	O
the	O
larger	O
members	O
might	O
be	O
expected	O
sometimes	O
to	O
proceed	O
from	O
an	O
ambitious	O
premeditation	O
in	O
their	O
rulers	,
with	O
a	O
view	O
to	O
getting	O
rid	O
of	O
all	O
external	O
control	O
upon	O
their	O
designs	O
of	O
personal	O
aggrandizement	;
the	O
better	O
to	O
effect	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
presumable	O
they	O
would	O
tamper	O
beforehand	O
with	O
leading	O
individuals	O
in	O
the	O
adjacent	O
states	.
if	O
associates	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
found	O
at	O
home	,
recourse	O
would	O
be	O
had	O
to	O
the	O
aid	O
of	O
foreign	O
powers	,
who	O
would	O
seldom	O
be	O
disinclined	O
to	O
encouraging	O
the	O
dissensions	O
of	O
a	O
confederacy	,
from	O
the	O
firm	O
union	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
so	O
much	O
to	O
fear	.
when	O
the	O
sword	O
is	O
once	O
drawn	,
the	O
passions	O
of	O
men	O
observe	O
no	O
bounds	O
of	O
moderation	.
the	O
suggestions	O
of	O
wounded	O
pride	,
the	O
instigations	O
of	O
irritated	O
resentment	,
would	O
be	O
apt	O
to	O
carry	O
the	O
states	O
against	O
which	O
the	O
arms	O
of	O
the	O
union	O
were	O
exerted	,
to	O
any	O
extremes	O
necessary	O
to	O
avenge	O
the	O
affront	O
or	O
to	O
avoid	O
the	O
disgrace	O
of	O
submission	.
the	O
first	O
war	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
would	O
probably	O
terminate	O
in	O
a	O
dissolution	O
of	O
the	O
union	.

<bos>	O
this	O
may	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
the	O
violent	O
death	O
of	O
the	O
confederacy	.
its	O
more	O
natural	O
death	O
is	O
what	O
we	O
now	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
on	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
experiencing	,
if	O
the	O
federal	O
system	O
be	O
not	O
speedily	O
renovated	O
in	O
a	O
more	O
substantial	O
form	.
it	O
is	O
not	O
probable	,
considering	O
the	O
genius	O
of	O
this	O
country	,
that	O
the	O
complying	O
states	O
would	O
often	O
be	O
inclined	O
to	O
support	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
union	O
by	O
engaging	O
in	O
a	O
war	O
against	O
the	O
non-complying	O
states	.
they	O
would	O
always	O
be	O
more	O
ready	O
to	O
pursue	O
the	O
milder	O
course	O
of	O
putting	O
themselves	O
upon	O
an	O
equal	O
footing	O
with	O
the	O
delinquent	O
members	O
by	O
an	O
imitation	O
of	O
their	O
example	.
and	O
the	O
guilt	O
of	O
all	O
would	O
thus	O
become	O
the	O
security	O
of	O
all	.
our	O
past	O
experience	O
has	O
exhibited	O
the	O
operation	O
of	O
this	O
spirit	O
in	O
its	O
full	O
light	.
there	O
would	,
in	O
fact	,
be	O
an	O
insuperable	O
difficulty	O
in	O
ascertaining	O
when	O
force	O
could	O
with	O
propriety	O
be	O
employed	.
in	O
the	O
article	O
of	O
pecuniary	O
contribution	,
which	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
most	O
usual	O
source	O
of	O
delinquency	,
it	O
would	O
often	O
be	O
impossible	O
to	O
decide	O
whether	O
it	O
had	O
proceeded	O
from	O
disinclination	O
or	O
inability	.
the	O
pretense	O
of	O
the	O
latter	O
would	O
always	O
be	O
at	O
hand	.
and	O
the	O
case	O
must	O
be	O
very	O
flagrant	O
in	O
which	O
its	O
fallacy	O
could	O
be	O
detected	O
with	O
sufficient	O
certainty	O
to	O
justify	O
the	O
harsh	O
expedient	O
of	O
compulsion	.
it	O
is	O
easy	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
this	O
problem	O
alone	,
as	O
often	O
as	O
it	O
should	O
occur	,
would	O
open	O
a	O
wide	O
field	O
for	O
the	O
exercise	O
of	O
factious	O
views	,
of	O
partiality	,
and	O
of	O
oppression	,
in	O
the	O
majority	O
that	O
happened	O
to	O
prevail	O
in	O
the	O
national	O
council	.

<bos>	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
require	O
no	O
pains	O
to	O
prove	O
that	O
the	O
states	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
prefer	O
a	O
national	O
constitution	O
which	O
could	O
only	O
be	O
kept	O
in	O
motion	O
by	O
the	O
instrumentality	O
of	O
a	O
large	O
army	O
continually	O
on	O
foot	O
to	O
execute	O
the	O
ordinary	O
requisitions	O
or	O
decrees	O
of	O
the	O
government	.
and	O
yet	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
plain	O
alternative	O
involved	O
by	O
those	O
who	O
wish	O
to	O
deny	O
it	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
extending	O
its	O
operations	O
to	O
individuals	.
such	O
a	O
scheme	,
if	O
practicable	O
at	O
all	,
would	O
instantly	O
degenerate	O
into	O
a	O
military	O
despotism	;
but	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
every	O
light	O
impracticable	.
the	O
resources	O
of	O
the	O
union	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
equal	O
to	O
the	O
maintenance	O
of	O
an	O
army	O
considerable	O
enough	O
to	O
confine	O
the	O
larger	O
states	O
within	O
the	O
limits	O
of	O
their	O
duty	;
nor	O
would	O
the	O
means	O
ever	O
be	O
furnished	O
of	O
forming	O
such	O
an	O
army	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
instance	.
whoever	O
considers	O
the	O
populousness	O
and	O
strength	O
of	O
several	O
of	O
these	O
states	O
singly	O
at	O
the	O
present	O
juncture	,
and	O
looks	O
forward	O
to	O
what	O
they	O
will	O
become	,
even	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
half	O
a	O
century	,
will	O
at	O
once	O
dismiss	O
as	O
idle	O
and	O
visionary	O
any	O
scheme	O
which	O
aims	O
at	O
regulating	O
their	O
movements	O
by	O
laws	O
to	O
operate	O
upon	O
them	O
in	O
their	O
collective	O
capacities	,
and	O
to	O
be	O
executed	O
by	O
a	O
coercion	O
applicable	O
to	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
capacities	.
a	O
project	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
is	O
little	O
less	O
romantic	O
than	O
the	O
monster-taming	O
spirit	O
which	O
is	O
attributed	O
to	O
the	O
fabulous	O
heroes	O
and	O
demi-gods	O
of	O
antiquity	.

<bos>	O
even	O
in	O
those	O
confederacies	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
composed	O
of	O
members	O
smaller	O
than	O
many	O
of	O
our	O
counties	,
the	O
principle	O
of	O
legislation	O
for	O
sovereign	O
states	,
supported	O
by	O
military	O
coercion	,
has	O
never	O
been	O
found	O
effectual	.
it	O
has	O
rarely	O
been	O
attempted	O
to	O
be	O
employed	,
but	O
against	O
the	O
weaker	O
members	;
and	O
in	O
most	O
instances	O
attempts	O
to	O
coerce	O
the	O
refractory	O
and	O
disobedient	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
signals	O
of	O
bloody	O
wars	,
in	O
which	O
one	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
confederacy	O
has	O
displayed	O
its	O
banners	O
against	O
the	O
other	O
half	.

<bos>	O
the	O
result	O
of	O
these	O
observations	O
to	O
an	O
intelligent	O
mind	O
must	O
be	O
clearly	O
this	,
that	O
if	O
it	O
be	O
possible	O
at	O
any	O
rate	O
to	O
construct	O
a	O
federal	O
government	O
capable	O
of	O
regulating	O
the	O
common	O
concerns	O
and	O
preserving	O
the	O
general	O
tranquillity	,
it	O
must	O
be	O
founded	,
as	O
to	O
the	O
objects	O
committed	O
to	O
its	O

upon	O
the	O
reverse	O
of	O
the	O
principle	O
contended	O
for	O
by	O
the	O
opponents	O
of	O
the	O
proposed	O

it	O
must	O
carry	O
its	O
agency	O
to	O
the	O
persons	O
of	O
the	O
citizens	.
it	O
must	O
stand	O
in	O
need	O
of	O
no	O
intermediate	O
legislations	;
but	O
must	O
itself	O
be	O
empowered	O
to	O
employ	O
the	O
arm	O
of	O
the	O
ordinary	O
magistrate	O
to	O
execute	O
its	O
own	O
resolutions	.
the	O
majesty	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
authority	O
must	O
be	O
manifested	O
through	O
the	O
medium	O
of	O
the	O
courts	O
of	O
justice	.
the	O
government	O
of	O
the	O
union	,
like	O
that	O
of	O

must	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
address	O
itself	O
immediately	O
to	O
the	O
hopes	O
and	O
fears	O
of	O
individuals	;
and	O
to	O
attract	O
to	O
its	O
support	O
those	O
passions	O
which	O
have	O
the	O
strongest	O
influence	O
upon	O
the	O
human	O
heart	.
it	O
must	,
in	O
short	,
possess	O
all	O
the	O
means	,
and	O
have	O
aright	O
to	O
resort	O
to	O
all	O
the	O
methods	,
of	O
executing	O
the	O
powers	O
with	O
which	O

<bos>	O
to	O
this	O
reasoning	O
it	O
may	O
perhaps	O
be	O
objected	,
that	O
if	O
any	O
state	O
should	O
be	O
disaffected	O
to	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
union	,
it	O
could	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
obstruct	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
its	O
laws	,
and	O
bring	O
the	O
matter	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
issue	O
of	O
force	,
with	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
which	O
the	O
opposite	O
scheme	O
is	O
reproached	.

<bos>	O
the	O
pausibility	O
of	O
this	O
objection	O
will	O
vanish	O
the	O
moment	O
we	O
advert	O
to	O
the	O
essential	O
difference	O
between	O
a	O
mere	O
non-compliance	O
and	O
a	O
direct	O
and	O
active	O
resistance	.
if	O
the	O
interposition	O
of	O
the	O
state	O

be	O
necessary	O
to	O

effect	O
to	O

be	O

not	O
to	O

if	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
the	O

of	O

will	O

the	O

of	O

with	O
this	O
qualification	,
however	,
that	O
it	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
been	O

with	O
a	O

that	O

be	O
had	O
in	O
the	O

this	,

a	O

it	O

no	O

the	O

taken	O

that	O

when	O

those	O
which	O
are	O

the	O

is	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
rather	O
the	O

to	O
those	O
who	O
are	O
disposed	O
to	O
consider	,
as	O
innocent	O
omissions	O
in	O
the	O
state	O

what	O
they	O
regard	O
as	O
unpardonable	O
blemishes	O
in	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	,
nothing	O
can	O
be	O
said	;
or	O
at	O
most	,
they	O
can	O
only	O
be	O
asked	O
to	O
assign	O
some	O
substantial	O
reason	O
why	O
the	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
a	O
single	O
state	O
should	O
be	O
more	O
impregnable	O
to	O
the	O
lust	O
of	O
power	,
or	O
other	O
sinister	O
motives	,
than	O
the	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	?
if	O
they	O
can	O
not	O
do	O
this	,
they	O
ought	O
at	O

to	O
prove	O
to	O
us	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
easier	O
to	O
subvert	O
the	O
liberties	O
of	O
three	O
millions	O
of	O
people	,
with	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
local	O

of	O
two	O

who	O
are	O
destitute	O
of	O
that	O
advantage	.
and	O
in	O
relation	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
immediately	O
under	O
consideration	,
they	O
ought	O
to	O
convince	O
us	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
less	O
probable	O
that	O
a	O
predominant	O
faction	O
in	O
a	O

should	,
in	O

to	O
maintain	O
its	O
superiority	,
incline	O
to	O
a	O
preference	O
of	O
a	O
particular	O
class	O
of	O
electors	,
than	O
that	O
a	O
similar	O

should	O
take	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O

of	O
thirteen	O

there	O
remains	O
to	O

a	O

for	O
local	O
purposes	,
vary	O
between	O
extremes	O
as	O
wide	O
as	O
march	O

the	O
consequence	O
of	O
this	O
diversity	O
would	O
be	O
that	O
there	O
could	O
never	O
happen	O
a	O
total	O
dissolution	O
or	O
renovation	O
of	O
the	O
body	O
at	O
one	O
time	.
if	O
an	O
improper	O
spirit	O
of	O
any	O
kind	O
should	O
happen	O
to	O
prevail	O
in	O
it	,
that	O
spirit	O
would	O
be	O
apt	O
to	O
infuse	O
itself	O
into	O
the	O
new	O
members	,
as	O
they	O
come	O
forward	O
in	O
succession	.
the	O
mass	O
would	O
be	O
likely	O
to	O
remain	O
nearly	O
the	O
same	,
assimilating	O
constantly	O
to	O
itself	O
its	O
gradual	O
accretions	.
there	O
is	O
a	O
contagion	O
in	O
example	O
which	O
few	O
men	O
have	O
sufficient	O
force	O
of	O
mind	O
to	O
resist	.
i	O
am	O
inclined	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
treble	O
the	O
duration	O
in	O
office	,
with	O
the	O
condition	O
of	O
a	O
total	O
dissolution	O
of	O
the	O
body	O
at	O
the	O

time	,
might	O
be	O
less	O
formidable	O
to	O
liberty	O
than	O
one	O
third	O
of	O
that	O
duration	O
subject	O
to	O
gradual	O
and	O
successive	O
alterations	.

<bos>	O
uniformity	O
in	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
elections	O
seems	O
not	O
less	O
requisite	O
for	O
executing	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
a	O
regular	O
rotation	O
in	O
the	O
senate	,
and	O
for	O
conveniently	O
assembling	O
the	O
legislature	O
at	O
a	O
stated	O
period	O
in	O
each	O
year	.

<bos>	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
asked	,
why	,
then	,
could	O
not	O
a	O
time	O
have	O
been	O
fixed	O
in	O
the	O
constitution	?
as	O
the	O
most	O
zealous	O
adversaries	O
of	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	O
in	O
this	O
state	O
are	,
in	O
general	,
not	O
less	O
zealous	O
admirers	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
the	O
state	,
the	O
question	O
may	O
be	O
retorted	,
and	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
asked	,
why	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
time	O
for	O
the	O
like	O
purpose	O
fixed	O
in	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
this	O
state	?
no	O
better	O
answer	O
can	O
be	O
given	O
than	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
matter	O
which	O
might	O
safely	O
be	O
entrusted	O
to	O
legislative	O
discretion	;
and	O
that	O
if	O
a	O
time	O
had	O
been	O
appointed	,
it	O
might	,
upon	O
experiment	,
have	O
been	O
found	O
less	O
convenient	O
than	O
some	O
other	O
time	.
the	O
same	O
answer	O
may	O
be	O
given	O
to	O
the	O
question	O
put	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	.
and	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
added	O
that	O
the	O
supposed	O
danger	O
of	O
a	O
gradual	O
change	O
being	O
merely	O
speculative	,
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
hardly	O
advisable	O
upon	O
that	O
speculation	O
to	O
establish	,
as	O
a	O
fundamental	O
point	,
what	O
would	O
deprive	O
several	O
states	O
of	O
the	O
convenience	O
of	O
having	O
the	O
elections	O
for	O
their	O
own	O
governments	O
and	O
for	O
the	O
national	O

conclude	O
this	O

with	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
judicial	O

of	O
the	O

<bos>	O
a	O
well-constituted	O
court	O
for	O
the	O
trial	O
of	O
impeachments	O
is	O
an	O
object	O
not	O
more	O
to	O
be	O
desired	O
than	O
difficult	O
to	O
be	O
obtained	O
in	O
a	O
government	O
wholly	O
elective	.
the	O
subjects	O
of	O
its	O
jurisdiction	O
are	O
those	O
offenses	O
which	O
proceed	O
from	O
the	O
misconduct	O
of	O
public	O
men	,
or	,
in	O
other	O
words	,
from	O
the	O
abuse	O
or	O
violation	O
of	O
some	O
public	O
trust	.
they	O
are	O
of	O
a	O
nature	O
which	O
may	O
with	O
peculiar	O
propriety	O
be	O
denominated	O
political	,
as	O
they	O
relate	O
chiefly	O
to	O
injuries	O
done	O
immediately	O
to	O
the	O
society	O
itself	.
the	O
prosecution	O
of	O
them	,
for	O
this	O
reason	,
will	O
seldom	O
fail	O
to	O
agitate	O
the	O
passions	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O

to	O
divide	O
it	O
into	O
parties	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
friendly	O
or	O
inimical	O
to	O
the	O
accused	.
in	O
many	O
cases	O
it	O
will	O
connect	O
itself	O
with	O
the	O
pre-existing	O
factions	,
and	O
will	O
enlist	O
all	O
their	O
animosities	,
partialities	,
influence	,
and	O
interest	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
or	O
on	O
the	O
other	;
and	O
in	O
such	O
cases	O
there	O
will	O
always	O
be	O
the	O
greatest	O
danger	O
that	O
the	O
decision	O
will	O
be	O
regulated	O
more	O
by	O
the	O
comparative	O
strength	O
of	O
parties	,
than	O
by	O
the	O
real	O
demonstrations	O
of	O
innocence	O
or	O
guilt	.

<bos>	O
the	O
delicacy	O
and	O
magnitude	O
of	O
a	O
trust	O
which	O

reputation	O

rightly	,
in	O
a	O
government	O

entirely	O
on	O
the	O
basis	O
of	O
periodical	O
elections	,
will	O

that	O

those	O
who	O
can	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

could	O

relied	O
upon	O
as	O

this	O
description	?
it	O
is	O
much	O
to	O
be	O
doubted	,
whether	O
the	O
members	O

that	O

would	O
at	O
all	O
times	O
be	O
endowed	O
with	O
so	O
eminent	O
a	O
portion	O
of	O
fortitude	,
as	O
would	O
be	O
called	O
for	O
in	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
so	O
difficult	O
a	O
task	;
and	O
it	O
is	O
still	O
more	O
to	O
be	O
doubted	,
whether	O
they	O
would	O
possess	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
credit	O

authority	,
which	O
might	,
on	O
certain	O

be	O
indispensable	O
towards	O
reconciling	O
the	O
people	O
to	O
a	O
decision	O
that	O
should	O
happen	O
to	O
clash	O
with	O
an	O
accusation	O
brought	O
by	O
their	O
immediate	O
representatives	.
a	O
deficiency	O
in	O
the	O
first	,
would	O
be	O
fatal	O
to	O
the	O
accused	;
in	O
the	O
last	,
dangerous	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
tranquillity	.
the	O
hazard	O
in	O
both	O
these	O
respects	,
could	O
only	O
be	O
avoided	,
if	O
at	O
all	,
by	O
rendering	O
that	O
tribunal	O
more	O
numerous	O
than	O
would	O
consist	O
with	O
a	O
reasonable	O
attention	O
to	O
economy	.
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
a	O
numerous	O
court	O
for	O
the	O
trial	O
of	O
impeachments	,
is	O
equally	O
dictated	O
by	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
proceeding	.
this	O
can	O
never	O
be	O
tied	O
down	O
by	O
such	O
strict	O
rules	,
either	O
in	O
the	O
delineation	O
of	O
the	O
offense	O
by	O
the	O
prosecutors	,
or	O
in	O
the	O
construction	O
of	O
it	O
by	O
the	O
judges	,
as	O
in	O
common	O
cases	O
serve	O
to	O
limit	O
the	O
discretion	O
of	O
courts	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O

there	O
will	O
be	O
no	O

who	O
are	O
to	O

the	O

and	O
the	O
party	O
who	O
is	O
to	O
receive	O
or	O
suffer	O
it	.
the	O
awful	O
discretion	O
which	O
a	O
court	O
of	O
impeachments	O
must	O
necessarily	O
have	,
to	O
doom	O
to	O
honor	O
or	O
to	O
infamy	O
the	O
most	O
confidential	O
and	O
the	O
most	O
distinguished	O
characters	O
of	O

the	O
commitment	O
of	O
the	O
trust	O
to	O
a	O
small	O
number	O
of	O
persons	.

<bos>	O
these	O
considerations	O
seem	O
alone	O
sufficient	O
to	O
authorize	O
a	O
conclusion	,
that	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
an	O
improper	O
substitute	O
for	O
the	O
senate	,
as	O
a	O
court	O
of	O
impeachments	.
there	O
remains	O
a	O
further	O
consideration	,
which	O
will	O
not	O
a	O
little	O
strengthen	O
this	O
conclusion	.
it	O
is	O
this	:
the	O
punishment	O
which	O
may	O
be	O
the	O
consequence	O
of	O
conviction	O
upon	O
impeachment	,
is	O
not	O
to	O
terminate	O
the	O
chastisement	O
of	O
the	O
offender	.
after	O
having	O
been	O
sentenced	O
to	O
a	O
prepetual	O

from	O
the	O
esteem	O
and	O
confidence	,
and	O

and	O
emoluments	O
of	O
his	O

he	O
will	O
still	O
be	O
liable	O
to	O
prosecution	O
and	O
punishment	O
in	O
the	O
ordinary	O
course	O
of	O

would	O
it	O
be	O
proper	O
that	O
the	O
persons	O
who	O

disposed	O
of	O
his	O
fame	,
and	O
his	O
most	O
valuable	O
rights	O
as	O
a	O
citizen	O
in	O
one	O
trial	,

in	O
another	O

for	O
the	O

offense	,
be	O
also	O
the	O
disposers	O
of	O
his	O
life	O

his	O
fortune	?
would	O
there	O
not	O
be	O
the	O
greatest	O
reason	O
to	O
apprehend	,
that	O
error	,
in	O
the	O
first	O
sentence	,
would	O
be	O
the	O
parent	O
of	O
error	O
in	O
the	O
second	O
sentence	?
that	O
the	O
strong	O
bias	O
of	O
one	O
decision	O
would	O
be	O
apt	O
to	O
overrule	O
the	O
influence	O
of	O
any	O
new	O
lights	O
which	O
might	O
be	O
brought	O
to	O
vary	O
the	O
complexion	O
of	O
another	O
decision	?
those	O
who	O
know	O
anything	O
of	O
human	O
nature	,
will	O
not	O
hesitate	O
to	O
answer	O
these	O
questions	O
in	O
the	O
affirmative	;
and	O
will	O
be	O
at	O
no	O
loss	O
to	O
perceive	,
that	O
by	O
making	O
the	O

in	O
both	O
cases	,
those	O
who	O
might	O
happen	O
to	O

them	O
by	O
a	O

the	O

would	O
often	O
be	O
virtually	O

in	O
a	O

nothing	O

it	O
may	O
be	O
said	,
that	O
the	O
intervention	O
of	O
a	O
jury	,
in	O
the	O
second	O
instance	,
would	O
obviate	O
the	O
danger	.
but	O
juries	O
are	O
frequently	O
influenced	O
by	O
the	O
opinions	O
of	O
judges	.
they	O
are	O
sometimes	O
induced	O
to	O
find	O
special	O
verdicts	,
which	O
refer	O
the	O
main	O
question	O
to	O
the	O
decision	O
of	O
the	O
court	.
who	O
would	O
be	O
willing	O
to	O
stake	O
his	O
life	O
and	O
his	O
estate	O
upon	O
the	O
verdict	O
of	O
a	O
jury	O
acting	O
under	O
the	O
auspices	O
of	O
judges	O
who	O
had	O
predetermined	O
his	O
guilt	?

<bos>	O
would	O
it	O
have	O
been	O
an	O
improvement	O
of	O
the	O
plan	,
to	O
have	O
united	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	O
with	O
the	O
senate	,
in	O
the	O
formation	O
of	O
the	O
court	O
of	O
impeachments	?
this	O
union	O
would	O
certainly	O
have	O
been	O
attended	O
with	O
several	O
advantages	;
but	O
would	O
they	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
overbalanced	O
by	O
the	O
signal	O
disadvantage	,
already	O
stated	,
arising	O
from	O
the	O
agency	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
judges	O
in	O
the	O
double	O
prosecution	O
to	O
which	O
the	O
offender	O
would	O
be	O
liable	?
to	O
a	O
certain	O
extent	,
the	O
benefits	O
of	O
that	O

will	O
be	O

from	O

the	O

as	O
is	O
proposed	O
to	O

done	O
in	O

the	O
inconveniences	O
of	O
an	O
entire	O
incorporation	O
of	O
the	O
former	O
into	O
the	O
latter	O
will	O
be	O
substantially	O

this	O
was	O
perhaps	O
the	O
prudent	O
mean	.
i	O
forbear	O
to	O
remark	O
upon	O
the	O
additional	O
pretext	O
for	O
clamor	O
against	O
the	O
judiciary	,
which	O
so	O
considerable	O
an	O
augmentation	O
of	O
its	O
authority	O
would	O
have	O
afforded	.

<bos>	O
would	O
it	O
have	O
been	O
desirable	O
to	O
have	O
composed	O
the	O
court	O
for	O
the	O
trial	O
of	O
impeachments	,
of	O
persons	O
wholly	O
distinct	O
from	O
the	O
other	O
departments	O
of	O
the	O
government	?
there	O
are	O
weighty	O
arguments	,
as	O
well	O
against	,
as	O
in	O
favor	O
of	,
such	O
a	O
plan	.
to	O
some	O
minds	O
it	O
will	O
not	O
appear	O
a	O
trivial	O
objection	,
that	O
it	O
could	O
tend	O
to	O
increase	O
the	O
complexity	O
of	O
the	O
political	O
machine	,
and	O
to	O
add	O
a	O
new	O
spring	O
to	O
the	O
government	,
the	O
utility	O
of	O
which	O
would	O
at	O
best	O
be	O
questionable	.
but	O
an	O
objection	O
which	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
thought	O
by	O
any	O
unworthy	O
of	O
attention	,
is	O
this	:
a	O
court	O
formed	O
upon	O
such	O
a	O
plan	,
would	O
either	O
be	O
attended	O
with	O
a	O
heavy	O
expense	,
or	O
might	O
in	O
practice	O
be	O
subject	O
to	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
casualties	O
and	O
inconveniences	.
it	O
must	O
either	O
consist	O
of	O
permanent	O
officers	,
stationary	O
at	O
the	O
seat	O
of	O
government	,
and	O
of	O
course	O
entitled	O
to	O
fixed	O
and	O
regular	O
stipends	,
or	O
of	O
certain	O
officers	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
governments	O
to	O
be	O
called	O
upon	O
whenever	O
an	O
impeachment	O
was	O
actually	O
depending	.
it	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
easy	O
to	O
imagine	O
any	O
third	O
mode	O
materially	O
different	,
which	O
could	O
rationally	O
be	O
proposed	.
as	O
the	O
court	,
for	O
reasons	O
already	O
given	,
ought	O
to	O
be	O
numerous	,
the	O
first	O
scheme	O
will	O
be	O
reprobated	O
by	O
every	O
man	O
who	O
can	O
compare	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
wants	O
with	O
the	O
means	O
of	O
supplying	O
them	.
the	O
second	O
will	O
be	O
espoused	O
with	O
caution	O
by	O
those	O
who	O
will	O
seriously	O
consider	O
the	O
difficulty	O
of	O
collecting	O
men	O
dispersed	O
over	O
the	O
whole	O
union	;
the	O
injury	O
to	O
the	O
innocent	,
from	O
the	O
procrastinated	O
determination	O
of	O
the	O
charges	O
which	O
might	O
be	O
brought	O
against	O
them	;
the	O
advantage	O
to	O
the	O
guilty	,
from	O
the	O
opportunities	O
which	O
delay	O
would	O
afford	O
to	O
intrigue	O
and	O
corruption	;
and	O
in	O
some	O
cases	O
the	O
detriment	O
to	O
the	O
state	,
from	O
the	O
prolonged	O
inaction	O
of	O
men	O
whose	O
firm	O
and	O
faithful	O
execution	O
of	O
their	O
duty	O
might	O
have	O
exposed	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
persecution	O
of	O
an	O
intemperate	O
or	O
designing	O
majority	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	.
though	O
this	O
latter	O
supposition	O
may	O
seem	O
harsh	,
and	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
likely	O
often	O
to	O
be	O
verified	,
yet	O
it	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
forgotten	O
that	O
the	O
demon	O
of	O
faction	O
will	,
at	O
certain	O
seasons	,
extend	O
his	O
sceptre	O
over	O
all	O
numerous	O
bodies	O
of	O
men	.

one	O
or	O
the	O

which	O
have	O
been	O
examined	,

some	O

that	O
might	O

preferable	O
to	O
the	O
plan	O
in	O
this	O

convention	,
it	O

that	O

if	O
mankind	O

in	O
no	O

it	O
had	O

adjusted	O
to	O
the	O
most	O

standard	O

where	O
is	O
the	O

opinions	O
of	O
a	O

the	O
purpose	O
of	O
the	O
adversaries	O

that	O

provisions	O
in	O
it	O
are	O
not	O
the	O
best	O
which	O
might	O

that	O
the	O

<bos>	O
to	O
the	O
people	O

<bos>	O
the	O
president	O
is	O
to	O
have	O
power	,
``	O
by	O
and	O
with	O
the	O
advice	O
and	O
consent	O
of	O
the	O
senate	,
to	O
make	O

two	O

<bos>	O
though	O
this	O
provision	O
has	O
been	O
assailed	,
on	O
different	O
grounds	,
with	O
no	O
small	O
degree	O
of	O
vehemence	,
i	O
scruple	O
not	O
to	O
declare	O
my	O
firm	O
persuasion	,
that	O
it	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
digested	O
and	O
most	O
unexceptionable	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
plan	.
one	O
ground	O
of	O
objection	O
is	O
the	O
trite	O
topic	O
of	O
the	O
intermixture	O
of	O
powers	;
some	O
contending	O
that	O
the	O
president	O
ought	O
alone	O
to	O
possess	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
making	O
treaties	;
others	,
that	O
it	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
exclusively	O
deposited	O
in	O
the	O
senate	.
another	O
source	O
of	O
objection	O
is	O
derived	O
from	O
the	O
small	O
number	O
of	O
persons	O
by	O
whom	O
a	O
treaty	O
may	O
be	O
made	.
of	O
those	O
who	O
espouse	O
this	O
objection	,
a	O
part	O
are	O
of	O
opinion	O
that	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
associated	O
in	O
the	O
business	,
while	O
another	O
part	O
seem	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
nothing	O
more	O
was	O
necessary	O
than	O
to	O
have	O
substituted	O
two	O
thirds	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
senate	,
to	O
two	O
thirds	O
of	O
the	O
members	O
present	.
as	O
i	O
flatter	O
myself	O
the	O
observations	O
made	O
in	O
a	O
preceding	O
number	O
upon	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
plan	O
must	O
have	O
sufficed	O
to	O
place	O
it	,
to	O
a	O
discerning	O
eye	,
in	O
a	O
very	O
favorable	O
light	,
i	O
shall	O
here	O
content	O
myself	O
with	O
offering	O
only	O
some	O
supplementary	O
remarks	,
principally	O
with	O
a	O
view	O
to	O
the	O
objections	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
just	O
stated	.

<bos>	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
intermixture	O
of	O
powers	,
i	O
shall	O
rely	O
upon	O
the	O
explanations	O
already	O
given	O
in	O
other	O
places	,
of	O
the	O
true	O
sense	O
of	O
the	O
rule	O
upon	O
which	O
that	O
objection	O
is	O
founded	;
and	O
shall	O
take	O
it	O
for	O
granted	,
as	O
an	O
inference	O
from	O
them	,
that	O
the	O
union	O
of	O
the	O
executive	O
with	O
the	O
senate	,
in	O
the	O
article	O
of	O
treaties	,
is	O
no	O
infringement	O
of	O
that	O
rule	.
i	O
venture	O
to	O
add	,
that	O
the	O
particular	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
making	O
treaties	O
indicates	O
a	O
peculiar	O
propriety	O
in	O
that	O
union	.
though	O
several	O
writers	O
on	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
government	O
place	O
that	O
power	O
in	O
the	O
class	O
of	O
executive	O
authorities	,
yet	O
this	O
is	O
evidently	O
an	O
arbitrary	O
disposition	;
for	O
if	O
we	O
attend	O
carefully	O
to	O
its	O
operation	,
it	O
will	O
be	O
found	O
to	O
partake	O
more	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
than	O
of	O
the	O
executive	O
character	,
though	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
seem	O
strictly	O
to	O
fall	O
within	O
the	O
definition	O
of	O
either	O
of	O
them	.
the	O
essence	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
authority	O
is	O
to	O
enact	O
laws	,
or	,
in	O
other	O
words	,
to	O
prescribe	O
rules	O
for	O
the	O
regulation	O
of	O
the	O
society	;
while	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
the	O
laws	,
and	O
the	O
employment	O
of	O
the	O
common	O
strength	,
either	O
for	O
this	O
purpose	O
or	O
for	O
the	O
common	O
defense	,
seem	O
to	O
comprise	O
all	O
the	O
functions	O
of	O
the	O
executive	O
magistrate	.
the	O
power	O
of	O
making	O
treaties	O
is	,
plainly	,
neither	O
the	O
one	O
nor	O
the	O
other	.
it	O
relates	O
neither	O
to	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
the	O
subsisting	O
laws	,
nor	O
to	O
the	O
enaction	O
of	O
new	O
ones	;
and	O
still	O
less	O
to	O
an	O
exertion	O
of	O
the	O
common	O
strength	.
its	O
objects	O
are	O
contracts	O
with	O
foreign	O
nations	,
which	O
have	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
law	,
but	O
derive	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
obligations	O
of	O
good	O
faith	.
they	O
are	O
not	O
rules	O
prescribed	O
by	O
the	O
sovereign	O
to	O
the	O
subject	,
but	O
agreements	O
between	O
sovereign	O
and	O
sovereign	.
the	O
power	O
in	O
question	O
seems	O
therefore	O
to	O
form	O
a	O
distinct	O
department	,
and	O
to	O
belong	,
properly	,
neither	O
to	O
the	O
legislative	O
nor	O
to	O
the	O
executive	.
the	O
qualities	O
elsewhere	O
detailed	O
as	O
indispensable	O
in	O
the	O
management	O
of	O
foreign	O
negotiations	,
point	O
out	O
the	O
executive	O
as	O
the	O
most	O
fit	O
agent	O
in	O
those	O
transactions	;
while	O
the	O
vast	O
importance	O
of	O
the	O
trust	,
and	O
the	O
operation	O
of	O
treaties	O
as	O
laws	,
plead	O
strongly	O
for	O
the	O
participation	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
or	O
a	O
portion	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
body	O
in	O
the	O
office	O
of	O
making	O
them	.

<bos>	O
however	O
proper	O
or	O
safe	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
in	O
governments	O
where	O
the	O
executive	O
magistrate	O
is	O
an	O
hereditary	O
monarch	,
to	O
commit	O
to	O
him	O
the	O
entire	O
power	O
of	O
making	O
treaties	,
it	O
would	O
be	O
utterly	O
unsafe	O
and	O
improper	O
to	O
intrust	O
that	O
power	O
to	O
an	O
elective	O
magistrate	O
of	O
four	O
years	'
duration	.
it	O
has	O
been	O
remarked	,
upon	O
another	O
occasion	,
and	O
the	O
remark	O
is	O
unquestionably	O
just	,
that	O
an	O
hereditary	O
monarch	,
though	O
often	O
the	O
oppressor	O
of	O
his	O
people	,
has	O
personally	O
too	O
much	O
stake	O
in	O
the	O

to	O
be	O
in	O
any	O
material	O
danger	O
of	O

it	O
is	O
true	O
that	O
the	O
senate	O
would	,
in	O
that	O
case	,
have	O
the	O
option	O
of	O
employing	O
him	O
in	O

they	O

also	O

the	O

pique	O

than	O
the	O
former	.
besides	O
this	,
the	O
ministerial	O
servant	O
of	O
the	O
senate	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
expected	O
to	O
enjoy	O
the	O
confidence	O

respect	O
of	O

powers	O
in	O
the	O

degree	O
with	O
the	O

a	O

advantage	O
in	O
the	O

it	O
would	O
be	O
imprudent	O
to	O

it	O
can	O

that	O

it	O
must	O
indeed	O
be	O
clear	O
to	O
a	O
demonstration	O
that	O
the	O
joint	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
power	O
in	O
question	,
by	O
the	O
president	O

the	O
circumstances	O
which	O
must	O
concur	O
in	O
the	O

its	O
future	O
increase	O
into	O
the	O
account	,
the	O
multitudinous	O
composition	O
of	O
that	O
body	,
forbid	O
us	O
to	O
expect	O
in	O
it	O
those	O
qualities	O
which	O
are	O
essential	O
to	O
the	O
proper	O
execution	O
of	O
such	O
a	O

accurate	O

with	O
the	O

of	O
a	O
body	O
so	O
variable	O
and	O
so	O
numerous	.
the	O
very	O
complication	O
of	O
the	O
business	,
by	O
introducing	O
a	O
necessity	O
of	O
the	O
concurrence	O
of	O
so	O
many	O
different	O
bodies	,
would	O
of	O
itself	O
afford	O
a	O
solid	O
objection	.
the	O
greater	O
frequency	O
of	O
the	O
calls	O
upon	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	,
and	O
the	O
greater	O
length	O
of	O
time	O
which	O
it	O
would	O
often	O
be	O
necessary	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
together	O
when	O
convened	,
to	O
obtain	O
their	O
sanction	O
in	O
the	O
progressive	O
stages	O
of	O
a	O
treaty	,
would	O
be	O
a	O
source	O
of	O
so	O
great	O
inconvenience	O
and	O
expense	O
as	O
alone	O
ought	O
to	O
condemn	O
the	O
project	.

<bos>	O
the	O
only	O
objection	O
which	O
remains	O
to	O
be	O
canvassed	,
is	O
that	O
which	O
would	O
substitute	O
the	O
proportion	O
of	O
two	O
thirds	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
members	O
composing	O
the	O
senatorial	O
body	,
to	O
that	O
of	O
two	O
thirds	O
of	O
the	O
members	O
present	.
it	O
has	O
been	O
shown	,
under	O
the	O
second	O
head	O
of	O
our	O
inquiries	,
that	O
all	O
provisions	O
which	O
require	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
any	O
body	O
to	O
its	O
resolutions	,
have	O
a	O
direct	O
tendency	O
to	O
embarrass	O
the	O
operations	O
of	O
the	O
government	,
and	O
an	O
indirect	O
one	O
to	O
subject	O
the	O
sense	O
of	O
the	O
majority	O
to	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
minority	.
this	O
consideration	O
seems	O
sufficient	O
to	O
determine	O
our	O
opinion	,
that	O
the	O
convention	O
have	O
gone	O
as	O
far	O
in	O
the	O
endeavor	O
to	O
secure	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
numbers	O
in	O
the	O
formation	O
of	O
treaties	O
as	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
reconciled	O
either	O
with	O
the	O
activity	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
councils	O
or	O
with	O
a	O
reasonable	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
major	O
sense	O
of	O
the	O
community	.
if	O
two	O
thirds	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
number	O
of	O
members	O
had	O
been	O
required	,
it	O
would	,
in	O
many	O
cases	,
from	O
the	O
non-attendance	O
of	O
a	O
part	,
amount	O
in	O
practice	O
to	O
a	O
necessity	O
of	O
unanimity	.
and	O
the	O
history	O
of	O
every	O
political	O
establishment	O
in	O
which	O
this	O
principle	O
has	O
prevailed	,
is	O
a	O
history	O
of	O
impotence	,
perplexity	,
and	O
disorder	.
proofs	O
of	O
this	O
position	O
might	O
be	O
adduced	O
from	O
the	O
examples	O
of	O
the	O
roman	O
tribuneship	,
the	O
polish	O
diet	,
and	O
the	O
states-general	O
of	O
the	O
netherlands	,
did	O
not	O
an	O
example	O
at	O
home	O
render	O
foreign	O
precedents	O
unnecessary	.

<bos>	O
to	O
require	O
a	O
fixed	O
proportion	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
body	O
would	O
not	,
in	O
all	O
probability	,
contribute	O
to	O
the	O
advantages	O
of	O
a	O
numerous	O
agency	,
better	O
then	O
merely	O
to	O
require	O
a	O
proportion	O
of	O
the	O
attending	O
members	.
the	O
former	,
by	O
making	O
a	O
determinate	O
number	O
at	O
all	O
times	O
requisite	O
to	O
a	O
resolution	,
diminishes	O
the	O
motives	O
to	O
punctual	O
attendance	.
the	O
latter	,
by	O
making	O
the	O
capacity	O
of	O
the	O
body	O
to	O
depend	O
on	O
a	O
proportion	O
which	O
may	O
be	O
varied	O
by	O
the	O
absence	O
or	O
presence	O
of	O
a	O
single	O
member	,
has	O
the	O
contrary	O
effect	.
and	O
as	,
by	O
promoting	O
punctuality	,
it	O
tends	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
body	O
complete	,
there	O
is	O
great	O
likelihood	O
that	O
its	O
resolutions	O
would	O
generally	O
be	O
dictated	O
by	O
as	O
great	O
a	O
number	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
as	O
in	O
the	O
other	;
while	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
much	O
fewer	O
occasions	O
of	O
delay	.
it	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
forgotten	O
that	,
under	O
the	O
existing	O
confederation	,
two	O
members	O
may	,
and	O
usually	O
do	,
represent	O
a	O
state	;
whence	O
it	O
happens	O
that	O
congress	,
who	O
now	O
are	O
solely	O
invested	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
powers	O
of	O
the	O
union	,
rarely	O
consist	O
of	O
a	O
greater	O
number	O
of	O
persons	O
than	O
would	O
compose	O
the	O
intended	O
senate	.
if	O
we	O
add	O
to	O
this	,
that	O
as	O
the	O
members	O
vote	O
by	O
states	,
and	O
that	O
where	O
there	O
is	O
only	O
a	O
single	O
member	O
present	O
from	O
a	O
state	,
his	O
vote	O
is	O
lost	,
it	O
will	O
justify	O
a	O
supposition	O
that	O
the	O
active	O
voices	O
in	O
the	O
senate	,
where	O
the	O
members	O
are	O
to	O
vote	O
individually	,
would	O
rarely	O
fall	O
short	O
in	O
number	O
of	O
the	O
active	O
voices	O
in	O
the	O
existing	O
congress	.
when	,
in	O
addition	O
to	O
these	O
considerations	,
we	O
take	O
into	O
view	O
the	O
co-operation	O
of	O
the	O
president	,
we	O
shall	O
not	O
hesitate	O
to	O
infer	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
america	O
would	O
have	O
greater	O
security	O
against	O
an	O
improper	O
use	O
of	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
making	O
treaties	,
under	O
the	O
new	O
constitution	,
than	O
they	O
now	O
enjoy	O
under	O
the	O
confederation	.
and	O
when	O
we	O
proceed	O
still	O
one	O
step	O
further	,
and	O
look	O
forward	O
to	O
the	O
probable	O
augmentation	O
of	O
the	O
senate	,
by	O
the	O
erection	O
of	O
new	O
states	,
we	O
shall	O
not	O
only	O
perceive	O
ample	O
ground	O
of	O
confidence	O
in	O
the	O
sufficiency	O
of	O
the	O
members	O
to	O
whose	O
agency	O
that	O
power	O
will	O
be	O
intrusted	,
but	O
we	O
shall	O
probably	O
be	O
led	O
to	O
conclude	O
that	O
a	O
body	O
more	O
numerous	O
than	O
the	O
senate	O
would	O
be	O
likely	O
to	O
become	,
would	O
be	O
very	O
little	O
fit	O
for	O
the	O
proper	O
discharge	O
of	O
the	O
trust	.

<bos>	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
new	O
york	:

<bos>	O
to	O
judge	O
with	O
accuracy	O
of	O
the	O
proper	O
extent	O
of	O
the	O
federal	O
judicature	,
it	O
will	O
be	O
necessary	O
to	O
consider	,
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	,
what	O
are	O
its	O
proper	O
objects	.

<bos>	O
it	O
seems	O
scarcely	O
to	O
admit	O
of	O
controversy	,
that	O
the	O
judicary	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
union	O
ought	O
to	O
extend	O
to	O
these	O
several	O
descriptions	O
of	O
cases	:
1st	,
to	O
all	O
those	O
which	O
arise	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
laws	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	,
passed	O
in	O
pursuance	O
of	O
their	O
just	O
and	O
constitutional	O
powers	O
of	O
legislation	;
2d	,
to	O
all	O
those	O
which	O
concern	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
the	O
provisions	O
expressly	O
contained	O
in	O
the	O
articles	O
of	O
union	;
3d	,
to	O
all	O
those	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
are	O
a	O
party	;
4th	,
to	O
all	O
those	O
which	O
involve	O
the	O
peace	O
of	O
the	O
confederacy	,
whether	O
they	O
relate	O
to	O
the	O
intercourse	O
between	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
and	O
foreign	O
nations	,
or	O
to	O
that	O
between	O
the	O
states	O
themselves	;
5th	,
to	O
all	O
those	O
which	O
originate	O
on	O
the	O
high	O
seas	,
and	O
are	O
of	O
admiralty	O
or	O
maritime	O
jurisdiction	;
and	,
lastly	,
to	O
all	O
those	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
state	O
tribunals	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
impartial	O
and	O
unbiased	.

<bos>	O
the	O
first	O
point	O
depends	O
upon	O
this	O
obvious	O
consideration	,
that	O
there	O
ought	O
always	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
constitutional	O
method	O
of	O
giving	O
efficacy	O
to	O
constitutional	O
provisions	.
what	,
for	O
instance	,
would	O
avail	O
restrictions	O
on	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	,
without	O
some	O
constitutional	O
mode	O
of	O
enforcing	O
the	O
observance	O
of	O
them	?
the	O
states	,
by	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	,
are	O
prohibited	O
from	O
doing	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
things	,
some	O
of	O
which	O
are	O
incompatible	O
with	O
the	O
interests	O
of	O
the	O
union	,
and	O
others	O
with	O
the	O
principles	O
of	O
good	O
government	.
the	O
imposition	O
of	O
duties	O
on	O
imported	O
articles	,
and	O
the	O
emission	O
of	O
paper	O
money	,
are	O
specimens	O
of	O
each	O
kind	.
no	O
man	O
of	O
sense	O
will	O
believe	,
that	O
such	O
prohibitions	O
would	O
be	O
scrupulously	O
regarded	,
without	O
some	O
effectual	O
power	O
in	O
the	O
government	O
to	O
restrain	O
or	O
correct	O
the	O
infractions	O
of	O
them	.
this	O
power	O
must	O
either	O
be	O
a	O
direct	O
negative	O
on	O
the	O
state	O
laws	,
or	O
an	O
authority	O
in	O
the	O
federal	O
courts	O
to	O
overrule	O
such	O
as	O
might	O
be	O
in	O
manifest	O
contravention	O
of	O
the	O
articles	O
of	O
union	.
there	O
is	O
no	O
third	O
course	O
that	O
i	O
can	O
imagine	.
the	O
latter	O
appears	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
thought	O
by	O
the	O
convention	O
preferable	O
to	O
the	O
former	,
and	,
i	O
presume	,
will	O
be	O
most	O
agreeable	O
to	O
the	O
states	.

<bos>	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
second	O
point	,
it	O
is	O
impossible	,
by	O
any	O
argument	O
or	O
comment	,
to	O
make	O
it	O
clearer	O
than	O
it	O
is	O
in	O
itself	.
if	O
there	O
are	O
such	O
things	O
as	O
political	O
axioms	,
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
the	O
judicial	O
power	O
of	O
a	O
government	O
being	O
coextensive	O
with	O
its	O
legislative	,
may	O
be	O
ranked	O
among	O
the	O
number	.
the	O
mere	O
necessity	O
of	O
uniformity	O
in	O
the	O
interpretation	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
laws	,
decides	O
the	O
question	.
thirteen	O
independent	O
courts	O
of	O
final	O
jurisdiction	O
over	O
the	O
same	O
causes	,
arising	O
upon	O
the	O
same	O
laws	,
is	O
a	O
hydra	O
in	O
government	,
from	O
which	O
nothing	O
but	O
contradiction	O
and	O
confusion	O
can	O
proceed	.

<bos>	O
still	O
less	O
need	O
be	O
said	O
in	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
third	O
point	.
controversies	O
between	O
the	O
nation	O
and	O
its	O
members	O
or	O
citizens	,
can	O
only	O
be	O
properly	O
referred	O
to	O
the	O
national	O
tribunals	.
any	O
other	O
plan	O
would	O
be	O
contrary	O
to	O
reason	,
to	O
precedent	,
and	O
to	O
decorum	.

<bos>	O
the	O
fourth	O

it	O
is	O
at	O

would	O
not	,

a	O

a	O

power	O
over	O
the	O
salary	O

of	O
the	O

they	O

this	O

of	O

in	O

it	O
will	O
be	O
found	O
that	O
a	O

over	O
a	O
man	O

is	O
a	O
power	O
over	O

it	O
were	O

it	O
is	O

highly	O
the	O

<bos>	O
the	O
last	O
of	O
the	O
requisites	O
to	O
energy	,
which	O
have	O
been	O
enumerated	,
are	O
competent	O
powers	.
let	O
us	O
proceed	O
to	O
consider	O
those	O
which	O
are	O
proposed	O
to	O
be	O
vested	O
in	O
the	O
president	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	.

<bos>	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
that	O
offers	O
itself	O
to	O
our	O
observation	,
is	O
the	O
qualified	O
negative	O
of	O
the	O
president	O
upon	O
the	O
acts	O
or	O
resolutions	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
houses	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	;
or	,
in	O
other	O
words	,
his	O
power	O
of	O
returning	O
all	O
bills	O
with	O
objections	,
to	O
have	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
preventing	O
their	O
becoming	O
laws	,
unless	O
they	O
should	O
afterwards	O
be	O
ratified	O
by	O
two	O
thirds	O
of	O
each	O
of	O
the	O
component	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
body	.

<bos>	O
the	O
propensity	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
department	O
to	O
intrude	O
upon	O
the	O
rights	,
and	O
to	O
absorb	O
the	O
powers	,
of	O
the	O
other	O
departments	,
has	O
been	O
already	O
suggested	O
and	O
repeated	;
the	O
insufficiency	O
of	O
a	O
mere	O
parchment	O
delineation	O
of	O
the	O
boundaries	O
of	O
each	,
has	O
also	O
been	O
remarked	O
upon	;
and	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
furnishing	O
each	O
with	O
constitutional	O
arms	O
for	O
its	O
own	O
defense	,
has	O
been	O
inferred	O
and	O
proved	.
from	O
these	O
clear	O
and	O
indubitable	O
principles	O
results	O
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
a	O
negative	,
either	O
absolute	O
or	O
qualified	,
in	O
the	O
executive	,
upon	O
the	O
acts	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
branches	.
without	O
the	O
one	O
or	O
the	O
other	,
the	O
former	O
would	O
be	O
absolutely	O
unable	O
to	O
defend	O
himself	O
against	O
the	O
depredations	O
of	O
the	O
latter	.
he	O
might	O
gradually	O
be	O
stripped	O
of	O
his	O
authorities	O
by	O
successive	O
resolutions	,
or	O
annihilated	O
by	O
a	O
single	O
vote	.
and	O
in	O
the	O
one	O
mode	O
or	O
the	O
other	,
the	O
legislative	O
and	O
executive	O
powers	O
might	O
speedily	O
come	O
to	O
be	O
blended	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
hands	.
if	O
even	O
no	O
propensity	O
had	O
ever	O
discovered	O
itself	O
in	O
the	O
legislative	O
body	O
to	O
invade	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
the	O
executive	,
the	O
rules	O
of	O
just	O
reasoning	O
and	O
theoretic	O
propriety	O
would	O
of	O
themselves	O
teach	O
us	,
that	O
the	O
one	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
left	O
to	O
the	O
mercy	O
of	O
the	O
other	,
but	O
ought	O
to	O
possess	O
a	O
constitutional	O
and	O
effectual	O
power	O
of	O
selfdefense	.

<bos>	O
but	O
the	O
power	O
in	O
question	O
has	O
a	O
further	O
use	.
it	O
not	O
only	O
serves	O
as	O
a	O
shield	O
to	O
the	O
executive	,
but	O
it	O
furnishes	O
an	O
additional	O
security	O
against	O
the	O
enaction	O
of	O
improper	O
laws	.
it	O
establishes	O
a	O
salutary	O
check	O
upon	O
the	O
legislative	O
body	,
calculated	O
to	O
guard	O
the	O
community	O
against	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
faction	,
precipitancy	,
or	O
of	O
any	O
impulse	O
unfriendly	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
good	,
which	O
may	O
happen	O
to	O
influence	O
a	O
majority	O
of	O
that	O
body	.

<bos>	O
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
a	O
negative	O
has	,
upon	O
some	O
occasions	,
been	O
combated	O
by	O
an	O
observation	,
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
presumed	O
a	O
single	O
man	O
would	O
possess	O
more	O
virtue	O
and	O
wisdom	O
than	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
men	;
and	O
that	O
unless	O
this	O
presumption	O
should	O
be	O
entertained	,
it	O
would	O
be	O
improper	O
to	O
give	O
the	O
executive	O
magistrate	O
any	O
species	O
of	O
control	O
over	O
the	O
legislative	O
body	.

<bos>	O
but	O
this	O
observation	,
when	O
examined	,
will	O
appear	O
rather	O
specious	O
than	O
solid	.
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
the	O
thing	O
does	O
not	O
turn	O
upon	O
the	O
supposition	O
of	O
superior	O
wisdom	O
or	O
virtue	O
in	O
the	O
executive	,
but	O
upon	O
the	O
supposition	O
that	O
the	O
legislature	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
infallible	;
that	O
the	O
love	O
of	O
power	O
may	O
sometimes	O
betray	O
it	O
into	O
a	O
disposition	O
to	O
encroach	O
upon	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
other	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
government	;
that	O
a	O
spirit	O
of	O
faction	O
may	O
sometimes	O
pervert	O
its	O
deliberations	;
that	O
impressions	O
of	O
the	O
moment	O
may	O
sometimes	O
hurry	O
it	O
into	O
measures	O
which	O
itself	,
on	O
maturer	O
reflexion	,
would	O
condemn	.
the	O
primary	O
inducement	O
to	O
conferring	O
the	O
power	O
in	O
question	O
upon	O
the	O
executive	O
is	,
to	O
enable	O
him	O
to	O
defend	O
himself	;
the	O
secondary	O
one	O
is	O
to	O
increase	O
the	O
chances	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
the	O
community	O
against	O
the	O
passing	O
of	O
bad	O
laws	,
through	O
haste	,
inadvertence	,
or	O
design	.
the	O
oftener	O
the	O
measure	O
is	O
brought	O
under	O
examination	,
the	O
greater	O
the	O
diversity	O
in	O
the	O
situations	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
are	O
to	O
examine	O
it	,
the	O
less	O
must	O
be	O
the	O
danger	O
of	O
those	O
errors	O
which	O
flow	O
from	O
want	O
of	O
due	O
deliberation	,
or	O
of	O
those	O
missteps	O
which	O
proceed	O
from	O
the	O
contagion	O
of	O
some	O
common	O
passion	O
or	O
interest	.
it	O
is	O
far	O
less	O
probable	,
that	O
culpable	O
views	O
of	O
any	O
kind	O
should	O
infect	O
all	O
the	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
moment	O
and	O
in	O
relation	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
object	,
than	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
by	O
turns	O
govern	O
and	O
mislead	O
every	O
one	O
of	O
them	.

<bos>	O
it	O
may	O
perhaps	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
preventing	O
bad	O
laws	O
includes	O
that	O
of	O
preventing	O
good	O
ones	;
and	O
may	O
be	O
used	O
to	O
the	O
one	O
purpose	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
other	.
but	O
this	O
objection	O
will	O
have	O
little	O
weight	O
with	O
those	O
who	O
can	O
properly	O
estimate	O
the	O
mischiefs	O
of	O
that	O
inconstancy	O
and	O
mutability	O
in	O
the	O
laws	,
which	O
form	O
the	O
greatest	O
blemish	O
in	O
the	O
character	O
and	O
genius	O
of	O
our	O
governments	.
they	O
will	O
consider	O
every	O
institution	O
calculated	O
to	O
restrain	O
the	O
excess	O
of	O
law-making	,
and	O
to	O
keep	O
things	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
state	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
happen	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
any	O
given	O
period	,
as	O
much	O
more	O
likely	O
to	O
do	O
good	O
than	O
harm	;
because	O
it	O
is	O
favorable	O
to	O
greater	O
stability	O
in	O
the	O
system	O
of	O
legislation	.
the	O
injury	O
which	O
may	O
possibly	O
be	O
done	O
by	O
defeating	O
a	O
few	O
good	O
laws	,
will	O
be	O
amply	O
compensated	O
by	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
preventing	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
bad	O
ones	.

a	O
very	O
considerable	O
period	O
has	O
elapsed	O
since	O
the	O
negative	O
of	O
the	O
crown	O
has	O
been	O
exercised	.

<bos>	O
if	O
a	O
magistrate	O
so	O
powerful	O
and	O
so	O
well	O
fortified	O
as	O
a	O
british	O
monarch	,
would	O
have	O
scruples	O
about	O
the	O
exercise	O
of	O
the	O
power	O
under	O
consideration	,
how	O
much	O
greater	O
caution	O
may	O
be	O
reasonably	O
expected	O
in	O
a	O
president	O
of	O

for	O
the	O
short	O
period	O
of	O
four	O

authority	O

republican	?

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
greater	O
danger	O
of	O
his	O
not	O
using	O
his	O
power	O
when	O
necessary	,

of	O

using	O
it	O

often	,

much	.
an	O
argument	,
indeed	,
against	O
its	O
expediency	,
has	O
been	O
drawn	O
from	O
this	O
very	O
source	.
it	O
has	O
been	O
represented	,
on	O
this	O
account	,
as	O
a	O
power	O
odious	O
in	O
appearance	,
useless	O
in	O
practice	.
but	O
it	O
will	O
not	O
follow	,
that	O
because	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
rarely	O
exercised	,
it	O
would	O
never	O
be	O
exercised	.
in	O
the	O
case	O
for	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
chiefly	O
designed	,
that	O
of	O
an	O
immediate	O
attack	O
upon	O
the	O
constitutional	O
rights	O
of	O
the	O
executive	,
or	O
in	O
a	O
case	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
public	O
good	O
was	O
evidently	O
and	O
palpably	O
sacrificed	,
a	O
man	O
of	O
tolerable	O
firmness	O
would	O
avail	O
himself	O
of	O
his	O
constitutional	O
means	O
of	O
defense	,
and	O
would	O
listen	O
to	O
the	O
admonitions	O
of	O
duty	O
and	O
responsibility	.
in	O
the	O
former	O
supposition	,
his	O
fortitude	O
would	O
be	O
stimulated	O
by	O
his	O
immediate	O
interest	O
in	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
his	O
office	;
in	O
the	O
latter	,
by	O
the	O
probability	O
of	O
the	O
sanction	O
of	O
his	O
constituents	,
who	,
though	O
they	O
would	O
naturally	O
incline	O
to	O
the	O
legislative	O
body	O
in	O
a	O
doubtful	O
case	,
would	O
hardly	O
suffer	O
their	O
partiality	O
to	O
delude	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
plain	O
case	.
i	O
speak	O
now	O
with	O
an	O
eye	O
to	O
a	O
magistrate	O
possessing	O
only	O
a	O
common	O
share	O
of	O
firmness	.
there	O
are	O
men	O
who	,
under	O
any	O
circumstances	,
will	O
have	O
the	O
courage	O
to	O
do	O
their	O
duty	O
at	O
every	O
hazard	.

<bos>	O
but	O
the	O
convention	O
have	O
pursued	O
a	O
mean	O
in	O
this	O
business	,
which	O
will	O
both	O
facilitate	O
the	O
exercise	O
of	O
the	O
power	O
vested	O
in	O
this	O
respect	O
in	O
the	O
executive	O
magistrate	,
and	O
make	O
its	O
efficacy	O
to	O
depend	O
on	O
the	O
sense	O
of	O
a	O
considerable	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
body	.
instead	O
of	O
an	O
absolute	O
negative	,
it	O
is	O
proposed	O
to	O
give	O
the	O
executive	O
the	O
qualified	O
negative	O
already	O
described	.
this	O
is	O
a	O
power	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
much	O
more	O
readily	O
exercised	O
than	O
the	O
other	.
a	O
man	O
who	O
might	O
be	O
afraid	O
to	O
defeat	O
a	O
law	O
by	O
his	O
single	O
veto	,
might	O
not	O
scruple	O
to	O
return	O
it	O
for	O
reconsideration	;
subject	O
to	O
being	O
finally	O
rejected	O
only	O
in	O
the	O
event	O
of	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
third	O
of	O
each	O
house	O
concurring	O
in	O
the	O
sufficiency	O
of	O
his	O
objections	.
he	O
would	O
be	O
encouraged	O
by	O
the	O
reflection	,
that	O
if	O
his	O
opposition	O
should	O
prevail	,
it	O
would	O
embark	O
in	O
it	O
a	O
very	O
respectable	O
proportion	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
body	,
whose	O
influence	O
would	O
be	O
united	O
with	O
his	O
in	O
supporting	O
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
his	O
conduct	O
in	O
the	O
public	O
opinion	.
a	O
direct	O
and	O
categorical	O
negative	O
has	O
something	O
in	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
it	O
more	O
harsh	,
and	O
more	O
apt	O
to	O
irritate	,
than	O
the	O
mere	O
suggestion	O
of	O
argumentative	O
objections	O
to	O
be	O
approved	O
or	O
disapproved	O
by	O
those	O
to	O
whom	O
they	O
are	O
addressed	.
in	O
proportion	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
less	O
apt	O
to	O
offend	,
it	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
apt	O
to	O
be	O
exercised	;
and	O
for	O
this	O
very	O
reason	,
it	O
may	O
in	O
practice	O
be	O
found	O
more	O
effectual	.
it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
hoped	O
that	O
it	O
will	O
not	O
often	O
happen	O
that	O
improper	O
views	O
will	O
govern	O
so	O
large	O
a	O
proportion	O
as	O
two	O
thirds	O
of	O
both	O
branches	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	O
at	O
the	O

time	;
and	O
this	,
too	,
in	O
spite	O
of	O
the	O
counterposing	O
weight	O
of	O
the	O
executive	.
it	O
is	O
at	O
any	O
rate	O
far	O
less	O
probable	O
that	O
this	O
should	O
be	O
the	O
case	,
than	O
that	O
such	O
views	O
should	O
taint	O
the	O
resolutions	O
and	O
conduct	O
of	O
a	O
bare	O
majority	.
a	O
power	O
of	O
this	O
nature	O
in	O
the	O
executive	,
will	O
often	O
have	O
a	O
silent	O
and	O
unperceived	,
though	O
forcible	,
operation	.
when	O
men	,
engaged	O
in	O
unjustifiable	O
pursuits	,
are	O
aware	O
that	O
obstructions	O
may	O
come	O
from	O
a	O
quarter	O
which	O
they	O
can	O
not	O
control	,
they	O
will	O
often	O
be	O
restrained	O
by	O
the	O
bare	O
apprehension	O
of	O
opposition	,
from	O
doing	O
what	O
they	O
would	O
with	O
eagerness	O
rush	O
into	,
if	O
no	O
such	O
external	O
impediments	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
feared	.

<bos>	O
this	O
qualified	O
negative	,
as	O
has	O
been	O
elsewhere	O
remarked	,

in	O
this	O
state	O
vested	O
in	O
a	O
council	,
consisting	O
of	O
the	O
governor	,
with	O
the	O
chancellor	O
and	O
judges	O
of	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	,
or	O
any	O
two	O
of	O
them	.
it	O
has	O
been	O
freely	O
employed	O
upon	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
occasions	,
and	O
frequently	O
with	O
success	.
and	O
its	O
utility	O
has	O
become	O
so	O
apparent	,
that	O
persons	O
who	,
in	O
compiling	O
the	O
constitution	,
were	O
violent	O
opposers	O
of	O
it	,
have	O
from	O
experience	O
become	O
its	O

admirers.1	O

<bos>	O
i	O
have	O
in	O
another	O
place	O
remarked	,
that	O
the	O
convention	,
in	O
the	O
formation	O
of	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
their	O
plan	,
had	O
departed	O
from	O
the	O
model	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
this	O
state	,
in	O
favor	O
of	O
that	O
of	O
massachusetts	.
two	O
strong	O
reasons	O
may	O
be	O
imagined	O
for	O
this	O
preference	.
one	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
judges	,
who	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
interpreters	O
of	O
the	O
law	,
might	O
receive	O
an	O
improper	O
bias	,
from	O
having	O
given	O
a	O
previous	O
opinion	O
in	O
their	O
revisionary	O
capacities	;
the	O
other	O
is	O
that	O
by	O
being	O
often	O
associated	O
with	O
the	O
executive	,
they	O
might	O
be	O
induced	O
to	O
embark	O
too	O
far	O
in	O
the	O
political	O
views	O
of	O
that	O
magistrate	,
and	O
thus	O
a	O
dangerous	O
combination	O
might	O
by	O
degrees	O
be	O
cemented	O
between	O
the	O
executive	O
and	O
judiciary	O
departments	.
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
judges	O
too	O
distinct	O
from	O
every	O
other	O
avocation	O
than	O
that	O
of	O
expounding	O
the	O
laws	.
it	O
is	O
peculiarly	O
dangerous	O
to	O
place	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
situation	O
to	O
be	O
either	O
corrupted	O
or	O
influenced	O
by	O

<bos>	O
the	O
three	O
last	O
numbers	O
of	O
this	O
paper	O
have	O
been	O
dedicated	O
to	O
an	O
enumeration	O
of	O
the	O
dangers	O
to	O
which	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
exposed	,
in	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
disunion	,
from	O
the	O
arms	O
and	O
arts	O
of	O
foreign	O
nations	.
i	O
shall	O
now	O
proceed	O
to	O
delineate	O
dangers	O
of	O
a	O
different	O
and	,
perhaps	,
still	O
more	O
alarming	O
kind	O
--	O
those	O
which	O
will	O
in	O
all	O
probability	O
flow	O
from	O
dissensions	O
between	O
the	O
states	O
themselves	,
and	O
from	O
domestic	O
factions	O
and	O
convulsions	.
these	O
have	O
been	O
already	O
in	O
some	O
instances	O
slightly	O
anticipated	;
but	O
they	O
deserve	O
a	O
more	O
particular	O
and	O
more	O
full	O
investigation	.

<bos>	O
a	O
man	O
must	O
be	O
far	O
gone	O
in	O
utopian	O
speculations	O
who	O
can	O
seriously	O
doubt	O
that	,
if	O
these	O
states	O
should	O
either	O
be	O
wholly	O
disunited	,
or	O
only	O
united	O
in	O
partial	O
confederacies	,
the	O
subdivisions	O
into	O
which	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
thrown	O
would	O

frequent	O
and	O
violent	O
contests	O
with	O
each	O
other	.
to	O
presume	O
a	O
want	O
of	O
motives	O
for	O
such	O
contests	O
as	O
an	O
argument	O
against	O
their	O
existence	,
would	O
be	O
to	O
forget	O
that	O
men	O
are	O
ambitious	,
vindictive	,
and	O
rapacious	.
to	O
look	O
for	O
a	O
continuation	O
of	O
harmony	O
between	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
independent	,
unconnected	O
sovereignties	O
in	O
the	O

neighborhood	,
would	O
be	O
to	O
disregard	O
the	O

to	O
set	O

to	O

stimulated	O
by	O
the	O

as	O

for	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
truth	,
which	O
the	O

that	O

the	O
existence	O

be	O
equally	O

the	O
design	O
of	O
the	O

to	O
preclude	O

in	O

it	O

the	O

in	O

or	O
not	.
if	O
it	O
be	O
confined	O
to	O
the	O
latter	O
it	O
will	O

it	O
will	O

what	O

denominated	O
``	O

we	O
say	O
they	O
may	O
be	O
continued	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
the	O
danger	O
which	O
occasioned	O
their	O
being	O

continues	?
this	O
would	O
be	O
to	O
admit	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
kept	O
up	O
in	O
time	O
of	O

against	O
threatening	O
or	O

danger	,
which	O
would	O
be	O
at	O
once	O
to	O
deviate	O
from	O
the	O
literal	O

of	O
the	O

to	O
introduce	O
an	O

latitude	O
of	O
construction	.
who	O
shall	O
judge	O
of	O
the	O
continuance	O
of	O
the	O
danger	?
this	O
must	O
undoubtedly	O
be	O
submitted	O
to	O
the	O

the	O
matter	O

be	O
brought	O
to	O
this	O
issue	,
that	O
the	O
national	O

to	O
provide	O
against	O

might	O
in	O
the	O

on	O

as	O
they	O
supposed	O
the	O
peace	O
or	O
safety	O
of	O
the	O
community	O
was	O
in	O
any	O
degree	O
of	O
jeopardy	.
it	O
is	O
easy	O
to	O
perceive	O
that	O
a	O
discretion	O
so	O
latitudinary	O
as	O
this	O
would	O
afford	O
ample	O
room	O
for	O

<bos>	O
the	O
supposed	O
utility	O

if	O
we	O
can	O
reasonably	O

such	O
a	O

to	O

that	O
the	O

the	O

the	O

that	O
of	O

an	O

this	O

in	O
one	O

an	O
authority	O
to	O
the	O
union	,
and	O
in	O
another	O
prohibited	O
the	O
states	O
from	O
exercising	O
the	O
like	O
authority	;
and	O
where	O
it	O
granted	O
an	O
authority	O
to	O
the	O
union	,
to	O
which	O
a	O
similar	O
authority	O
in	O
the	O
states	O
would	O
be	O
absolutely	O
and	O
totally	O
contradictory	O
and	O
repugnant	.
i	O
use	O
these	O
terms	O
to	O
distinguish	O
this	O
last	O
case	O
from	O
another	O
which	O
might	O
appear	O
to	O
resemble	O
it	,
but	O
which	O
would	,
in	O
fact	,
be	O
essentially	O
different	;
i	O
mean	O
where	O
the	O
exercise	O
of	O
a	O

productive	O
of	O

interferences	O

in	O
point	O
of	O

authority	.
these	O
three	O
cases	O
of	O
exclusive	O
jurisdiction	O
in	O
the	O
federal	O
government	O
may	O
be	O
exemplified	O
by	O
the	O
following	O
instances	:
the	O
last	O
clause	O
but	O
one	O
in	O
the	O
eighth	O
section	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
article	O
provides	O
expressly	O
that	O

legislation	O
''	O
over	O
the	O
district	O
to	O
be	O
appropriated	O
as	O
the	O
seat	O
of	O
government	.
this	O
answers	O
to	O
the	O
first	O
case	.
the	O
first	O
clause	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
section	O
empowers	O
congress	O
``	O
to	O
lay	O
and	O
collect	O
taxes	,
duties	,
imposts	O

''	;
and	O
the	O
second	O
clause	O
of	O
the	O
tenth	O
section	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
article	O
declares	O
that	,
``	O
no	O
state	O

the	O

lay	O
any	O
imposts	O

except	O
for	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O

its	O

''	O
hence	O
would	O
result	O
an	O

in	O
the	O

to	O
lay	O
duties	O
on	O
imports	O

exports	,
with	O
the	O
particular	O
exception	O
mentioned	;
but	O
this	O
power	O
is	O
abridged	O
by	O
another	O
clause	,
which	O
declares	O
that	O
no	O
tax	O
or	O
duty	O
shall	O
be	O
laid	O
on	O
articles	O
exported	O
from	O
any	O
state	;
in	O
consequence	O
of	O
which	O
qualification	,
it	O
now	O
only	O
extends	O
to	O
the	O
duties	O
on	O
imports	.
this	O
answers	O
to	O
the	O
second	O
case	.
the	O
third	O
will	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
that	O
clause	O
which	O
declares	O
that	O
congress	O
shall	O
have	O
power	O
``	O
to	O
establish	O
an	O
uniform	O
rule	O
of	O
naturalization	O
throughout	O
the	O
united	O
states	.
''	O
this	O
must	O
necessarily	O
be	O
exclusive	;
because	O
if	O
each	O
state	O
had	O
power	O
to	O
prescribe	O
a	O
distinct	O
rule	,
there	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
a	O

rule	.

<bos>	O
a	O
case	O
which	O
may	O
perhaps	O
be	O
thought	O
to	O
resemble	O
the	O
latter	,

which	O
is	O
in	O

imposing	O
taxes	O
on	O
all	O
articles	O

than	O

this	,

manifestly	O
a	O

coequal	O
authority	O
in	O
the	O
united	O

in	O

plainly	O
no	O
expression	O
in	O
the	O

which	O
makes	O
that	O
power	O
exclusive	O
in	O
the	O

no	O
independent	O
clause	O
or	O
sentence	O
which	O
prohibits	O
the	O

from	O

it	.
so	O
far	O

this	O

the	O

that	O
a	O
plain	O
and	O
conclusive	O

to	O

any	O

view	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
both	O

could	O

pregnant	O
that	O

a	O
negation	O

an	O

it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
this	O

that	O

the	O

no	O

the	O

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O

evident	,
that	O

would	O
be	O
able	,

hitherto	,
i	O
believe	,
it	O
may	O
safely	O
be	O
asserted	,
that	O
these	O

have	O
not	O
upon	O
an	O

exceeded	O
in	O
any	O

three	O

are	O

to	O
be	O
about	O
fifteen	O

and	O
in	O

they	O
exceed	O
this	O

to	O

nothing	O

the	O

the	O
whole	O

into	O
the	O

may	O
be	O
estimated	O
at	O
four	O
millions	O
of	O

at	O
a	O
shilling	O
per	O

would	O
produce	O
two	O

that	O

would	O
well	O

of	O

if	O
it	O
should	O
tend	O
to	O
diminish	O
the	O

of	O
it	,
such	O
an	O
effect	O
would	O
be	O
equally	O
favorable	O

nothing	O

that	O

these	O

the	O

of	O
those	O

those	O

the	O

the	O

a	O

this	O

it	O
applies	O
in	O
all	O

exactly	O
in	O

<bos>	O
it	O
may	O
in	O

be	O
observed	O
that	O
the	O

danger	O

encroachments	O
on	O
the	O
legislative	O
authority	,
which	O
has	O
been	O
upon	O

of	O
the	O

may	O
now	O

happen	;

they	O
can	O
never	O
be	O
so	O
extensive	O
as	O
to	O
amount	O
to	O
an	O
inconvenience	,
or	O
in	O
any	O
sensible	O
degree	O
to	O
affect	O
the	O
order	O
of	O
the	O
political	O
system	.
this	O
may	O
be	O
inferred	O
with	O
certainty	,
from	O
the	O
general	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
judicial	O
power	,
from	O
the	O
objects	O
to	O
which	O
it	O
relates	,
from	O
the	O
manner	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
exercised	,
from	O
its	O
comparative	O
weakness	,
and	O
from	O
its	O
total	O
incapacity	O
to	O
support	O
its	O
usurpations	O
by	O
force	.
and	O
the	O
inference	O
is	O
greatly	O
fortified	O
by	O
the	O
consideration	O
of	O
the	O
important	O
constitutional	O
check	O
which	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
instituting	O
impeachments	O
in	O
one	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
body	,

of	O

that	O

the	O

of	O
the	O
judicial	O
department	.
this	O
is	O
alone	O
a	O
complete	O
security	.
there	O
never	O
can	O
be	O
danger	O
that	O
the	O
judges	,
by	O
a	O
series	O
of	O
deliberate	O
usurpations	O
on	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	,
would	O
hazard	O
the	O
united	O
resentment	O
of	O
the	O
body	O
intrusted	O
with	O
it	,
while	O
this	O
body	O
was	O
possessed	O
of	O
the	O
means	O
of	O
punishing	O
their	O
presumption	,
by	O
degrading	O
them	O
from	O
their	O
stations	.
while	O
this	O
ought	O
to	O
remove	O
all	O
apprehensions	O
on	O
the	O
subject	,
it	O
affords	,
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	,
a	O
cogent	O
argument	O
for	O
constituting	O
the	O
senate	O
a	O
court	O
for	O
the	O
trial	O
of	O
impeachments	.

<bos>	O
having	O
now	O
examined	,
and	,
i	O
trust	,
removed	O
the	O
objections	O
to	O
the	O
distinct	O
and	O
independent	O
organization	O
of	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	,
i	O
proceed	O
to	O
consider	O
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
constituting	O
inferior	O
courts,2	O
and	O
the	O
relations	O
which	O
will	O
subsist	O
between	O
these	O
and	O
the	O
former	.

<bos>	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
constituting	O
inferior	O
courts	O
is	O
evidently	O
calculated	O
to	O
obviate	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
having	O
recourse	O
to	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	O
in	O
every	O
case	O
of	O
federal	O
cognizance	.
it	O
is	O
intended	O
to	O
enable	O
the	O
national	O
government	O
to	O
institute	O
or	O
authoruze	,
in	O
each	O
state	O
or	O
district	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	,
a	O
tribunal	O
competent	O
to	O
the	O
determination	O
of	O
matters	O
of	O
national	O
jurisdiction	O
within	O
its	O
limits	.

<bos>	O
but	O
why	,
it	O
is	O
asked	,
might	O
not	O
the	O
same	O
purpose	O
have	O
been	O
accomplished	O
by	O
the	O
instrumentality	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
courts	?
this	O
admits	O
of	O
different	O
answers	.
though	O
the	O
fitness	O
and	O
competency	O
of	O
those	O
courts	O
should	O
be	O
allowed	O
in	O
the	O
utmost	O
latitude	,
yet	O
the	O
substance	O
of	O
the	O
power	O
in	O
question	O
may	O
still	O
be	O
regarded	O
as	O
a	O
necessary	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
plan	,
if	O
it	O
were	O
only	O
to	O
empower	O
the	O
national	O
legislature	O
to	O
commit	O
to	O
them	O
the	O
cognizance	O
of	O
causes	O
arising	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
constitution	.
to	O
confer	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
determining	O
such	O
causes	O
upon	O
the	O
existing	O
courts	O
of	O
the	O
several	O
states	,
would	O
perhaps	O
be	O
as	O
much	O
``	O
to	O
constitute	O
tribunals	,
''	O
as	O
to	O
create	O
new	O
courts	O
with	O
the	O
like	O
power	.
but	O
ought	O
not	O
a	O
more	O
direct	O
and	O
explicit	O
provision	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
made	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
the	O

there	O
are	,
in	O
my	O
opinion	,
substantial	O
reasons	O
against	O
such	O
a	O
provision	:
the	O
most	O
discerning	O
can	O
not	O
foresee	O
how	O
far	O
the	O
prevalency	O
of	O
a	O
local	O
spirit	O
may	O
be	O
found	O
to	O
disqualify	O
the	O
local	O
tribunals	O
for	O
the	O
jurisdiction	O
of	O
national	O
causes	;
whilst	O
every	O
man	O
may	O
discover	,
that	O
courts	O
constituted	O
like	O
those	O

some	O
of	O

of	O

if	O
there	O

the	O

and	O
well	O
satisfied	O
as	O
i	O
am	O
of	O
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
the	O
appellate	O
jurisdiction	,
in	O
the	O
several	O
classes	O
of	O

to	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
extended	O
by	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O

i	O
should	O
consider	O
every	O
thing	O
calculated	O
to	O
give	,
in	O

an	O
unrestrained	O
course	O
to	O

as	O
a	O
source	O
of	O
public	O
and	O

inconvenience	.

<bos>	O
i	O
am	O
not	O
sure	,
but	O
that	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
found	O
highly	O
expedient	O
and	O
useful	,
to	O
divide	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
into	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
or	O
half	O
a	O
dozen	O

to	O

a	O

in	O

the	O

of	O
these	O

with	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

may	O
hold	O

for	O

in	O
the	O

the	O

justice	O
through	O
them	O
may	O

with	O
ease	O
and	O

and	O
appeals	O
may	O
be	O
safely	O
circumscribed	O
within	O
a	O

this	O
plan	O
appears	O
to	O
me	O
at	O
present	O
the	O
most	O
eligible	O
of	O
any	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
adopted	;
and	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
it	,
it	O
is	O
necessary	O
that	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
constituting	O
inferior	O
courts	O
should	O
exist	O
in	O
the	O
full	O
extent	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
proposed	O
constitution	.

<bos>	O
these	O
reasons	O
seem	O
sufficient	O
to	O
satisfy	O
a	O
candid	O
mind	,
that	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
power	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
great	O
defect	O
in	O

let	O
us	O
now	O
examine	O
in	O
what	O
manner	O
the	O
judicial	O
authority	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
distributed	O
between	O
the	O
supreme	O
and	O
the	O
inferior	O

of	O
the	O

the	O

to	O

without	O

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O
inherent	O
in	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
sovereignty	O
not	O
to	O

amenable	O
to	O
the	O

this	O

the	O

no	O
pretensions	O

a	O

they	O
confer	O
no	O
right	O
of	O
action	,
independent	O
of	O
the	O

will	.
to	O
what	O
purpose	O
would	O
it	O
be	O
to	O
authorize	O
suits	O
against	O
states	O
for	O
the	O
debts	O
they	O
owe	?
how	O
could	O
recoveries	O
be	O
enforced	?
it	O
is	O
evident	,
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
done	O
without	O
waging	O
war	O
against	O
the	O
contracting	O
state	;
and	O
to	O
ascribe	O
to	O
the	O
federal	O
courts	,
by	O
mere	O
implication	,
and	O
in	O
destruction	O
of	O
a	O
pre-existing	O
right	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
governments	,
a	O
power	O
which	O
would	O
involve	O
such	O
a	O
consequence	,
would	O
be	O
altogether	O
forced	O
and	O
unwarrantable	.

<bos>	O
let	O
us	O
resume	O
the	O
train	O
of	O
our	O
observations	.
we	O
have	O
seen	O
that	O
the	O
original	O
jurisdiction	O
of	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	O
would	O
be	O
confined	O
to	O
two	O
classes	O
of	O
causes	,
and	O
those	O
of	O
a	O
nature	O
rarely	O
to	O
occur	.
in	O
all	O
other	O
cases	O
of	O
federal	O
cognizance	,
the	O
original	O
jurisdiction	O
would	O
appertain	O
to	O
the	O
inferior	O
tribunals	;
and	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	O
would	O
have	O
nothing	O
more	O
than	O
an	O
appellate	O
jurisdiction	,
``	O
with	O
such	O
exceptions	O
and	O
under	O
such	O
regulations	O
as	O
the	O
congress	O
shall	O
make	.
''	O

<bos>	O
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
this	O
appellate	O
jurisdiction	O
has	O
been	O
scarcely	O
called	O
in	O
question	O
in	O
regard	O
to	O
matters	O
of	O
law	;
but	O
the	O
clamors	O
have	O
been	O
loud	O
against	O
it	O
as	O
applied	O
to	O
matters	O
of	O
fact	.
some	O
well-intentioned	O
men	O
in	O
this	O
state	,
deriving	O
their	O
notions	O
from	O
the	O
language	O
and	O
forms	O
which	O
obtain	O
in	O
our	O
courts	,
have	O
been	O
induced	O
to	O
consider	O
it	O
as	O
an	O
implied	O
supersedure	O
of	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	,
in	O
favor	O
of	O
the	O
civil-law	O
mode	O
of	O
trial	,
which	O
prevails	O
in	O
our	O
courts	O
of	O
admiralty	,
probate	,
and	O
chancery	.
a	O
technical	O
sense	O
has	O
been	O
affixed	O
to	O
the	O
term	O
``	O
appellate	,
''	O
which	,
in	O
our	O
law	O
parlance	,
is	O
commonly	O
used	O
in	O
reference	O
to	O
appeals	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
civil	O
law	.
but	O
if	O
i	O
am	O
not	O
misinformed	,
the	O
same	O
meaning	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
given	O
to	O
it	O
in	O
any	O
part	O
of	O
new	O
england	.
there	O
an	O
appeal	O
from	O
one	O
jury	O
to	O
another	,
is	O
familiar	O
both	O
in	O
language	O
and	O
practice	,
and	O
is	O
even	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
course	,
until	O
there	O
have	O
been	O
two	O
verdicts	O
on	O
one	O
side	.
the	O
word	O
``	O
appellate	,
''	O
therefore	,
will	O
not	O
be	O
understood	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
sense	O
in	O
new	O
england	O
as	O
in	O
new	O
york	,
which	O
shows	O
the	O
impropriety	O
of	O
a	O
technical	O
interpretation	O
derived	O
from	O
the	O
jurisprudence	O
of	O
any	O
particular	O
state	.
the	O
expression	,
taken	O
in	O
the	O
abstract	,
denotes	O
nothing	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
one	O
tribunal	O
to	O
review	O
the	O
proceedings	O
of	O
another	,
either	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
law	O
or	O
fact	,
or	O
both	.
the	O
mode	O
of	O
doing	O
it	O
may	O
depend	O
on	O
ancient	O
custom	O
or	O
legislative	O
provision	(
in	O
a	O
new	O
government	O
it	O
must	O
depend	O
on	O
the	O
latter	)
and	O
may	O
be	O
with	O
or	O
without	O
the	O
aid	O
of	O
a	O
jury	,
as	O
may	O
be	O
judged	O
advisable	.
if	,
therefore	,
the	O
re-examination	O
of	O
a	O
fact	O
once	O
determined	O
by	O
a	O
jury	,
should	O
in	O
any	O
case	O
be	O
admitted	O
under	O
the	O
proposed	O
constitution	,
it	O
may	O
be	O
so	O
regulated	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
by	O
a	O
second	O
jury	,
either	O
by	O
remanding	O
the	O
cause	O
to	O
the	O
court	O
below	O
for	O
a	O
second	O
trial	O
of	O
the	O
fact	,
or	O
by	O
directing	O
an	O
issue	O
immediately	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	.

<bos>	O
but	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
follow	O
that	O
the	O
re-examination	O
of	O
a	O
fact	O
once	O
ascertained	O
by	O
a	O
jury	,
will	O
be	O
permitted	O
in	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	.
why	O
may	O
not	O
it	O
be	O
said	,
with	O
the	O
strictest	O
propriety	,
when	O
a	O
writ	O
of	O
error	O
is	O
brought	O
from	O
an	O
inferior	O
to	O
a	O
superior	O
court	O
of	O
law	O
in	O
this	O
state	,
that	O
the	O
latter	O
has	O
jurisdiction	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
law	?
it	O
is	O
true	O
it	O
can	O
not	O
institute	O
a	O
new	O
inquiry	O
concerning	O
the	O
fact	,
but	O
it	O
takes	O
cognizance	O
of	O
it	O
as	O
it	O
appears	O
upon	O
the	O
record	,
and	O
pronounces	O
the	O
law	O
arising	O
upon	O
it.3	O
this	O
is	O
jurisdiction	O
of	O
both	O
fact	O
and	O
law	;
nor	O
is	O
it	O
even	O
possible	O
to	O
separate	O
them	.
though	O
the	O
common-law	O
courts	O
of	O
this	O
state	O
ascertain	O
disputed	O
facts	O
by	O
a	O
jury	,
yet	O
they	O
unquestionably	O
have	O
jurisdiction	O
of	O
both	O
fact	O
and	O
law	;
and	O
accordingly	O
when	O
the	O
former	O
is	O
agreed	O
in	O
the	O
pleadings	,
they	O
have	O
no	O
recourse	O
to	O
a	O
jury	,
but	O
proceed	O
at	O
once	O
to	O
judgment	.
i	O
contend	,
therefore	,
on	O
this	O
ground	,
that	O
the	O
expressions	,
``	O
appellate	O
jurisdiction	,
both	O
as	O
to	O
law	O
and	O
fact	,
''	O
do	O
not	O
necessarily	O
imply	O
a	O
re-examination	O
in	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	O
of	O
facts	O
decided	O
by	O
juries	O
in	O
the	O
inferior	O
courts	.

<bos>	O
the	O
following	O
train	O
of	O
ideas	O
may	O
well	O
be	O
imagined	O
to	O
have	O
influenced	O
the	O
convention	,
in	O
relation	O
to	O
this	O
particular	O
provision	.
the	O
appellate	O
jurisdiction	O
of	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	(
it	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
argued	)
will	O
extend	O
to	O
causes	O
determinable	O
in	O
different	O
modes	,
some	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
common	O
law	,
others	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
civil	O
law	.
in	O
the	O
former	,
the	O
revision	O
of	O
the	O
law	O
only	O
will	O
be	,
generally	O
speaking	,
the	O
proper	O
province	O
of	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	;
in	O
the	O
latter	,
the	O
re-examination	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
is	O
agreeable	O
to	O
usage	,
and	O
in	O
some	O
cases	,
of	O
which	O
prize	O
causes	O
are	O
an	O
example	,
might	O
be	O
essential	O
to	O
the	O
preservation	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
peace	.
it	O
is	O
therefore	O
necessary	O
that	O
the	O
appellate	O
jurisdiction	O
should	,
in	O
certain	O
cases	,
extend	O
in	O
the	O
broadest	O
sense	O
to	O
matters	O
of	O
fact	.
it	O
will	O
not	O
answer	O
to	O
make	O
an	O
express	O
exception	O
of	O
cases	O
which	O
shall	O
have	O
been	O
originally	O
tried	O
by	O
a	O
jury	,
because	O
in	O
the	O
courts	O
of	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
states	O
all	O
causes	O
are	O
tried	O
in	O
this	O
mode4	;
and	O
such	O
an	O
exception	O
would	O
preclude	O
the	O
revision	O
of	O
matters	O
of	O
fact	,
as	O
well	O
where	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
proper	,
as	O
where	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
improper	.
to	O
avoid	O
all	O
inconveniencies	,
it	O
will	O
be	O
safest	O
to	O
declare	O
generally	,
that	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	O
shall	O
possess	O
appellate	O
jurisdiction	O
both	O
as	O
to	O
law	O
and	O
fact	,
and	O
that	O
this	O
jurisdiction	O
shall	O
be	O
subject	O
to	O
such	O
exceptions	O
and	O
regulations	O
as	O
the	O
national	O
legislature	O
may	O
prescribe	.
this	O
will	O
enable	O
the	O
government	O
to	O
modify	O
it	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
as	O
will	O
best	O
answer	O
the	O
ends	O
of	O
public	O
justice	O
and	O
security	.

<bos>	O
this	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
matter	,
at	O
any	O
rate	,
puts	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
all	O
doubt	O
that	O
the	O
supposed	O
abolition	O
of	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	,
by	O
the	O
operation	O
of	O
this	O
provision	,
is	O
fallacious	O
and	O
untrue	.
the	O
legislature	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
would	O
certainly	O
have	O
full	O
power	O
to	O
provide	,
that	O
in	O
appeals	O
to	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
no	O
re-examination	O
of	O
facts	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
tried	O
in	O
the	O
original	O
causes	O
by	O
juries	.
this	O
would	O
certainly	O
be	O
an	O
authorized	O
exception	;
but	O
if	,
for	O
the	O
reason	O
already	O
intimated	,
it	O
should	O
be	O
thought	O
too	O
extensive	,
it	O
might	O
be	O
qualified	O
with	O
a	O
limitation	O
to	O
such	O
causes	O
only	O
as	O
are	O
determinable	O
at	O
common	O
law	O
in	O
that	O
mode	O
of	O
trial	.

<bos>	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
the	O
observations	O
hitherto	O
made	O
on	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
judicial	O
department	O
is	O
this	:
that	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
carefully	O
restricted	O
to	O
those	O
causes	O
which	O
are	O
manifestly	O
proper	O
for	O
the	O
cognizance	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
judicature	;
that	O
in	O
the	O
partition	O
of	O
this	O
authority	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
portion	O
of	O
original	O
jurisdiction	O
has	O
been	O
preserved	O
to	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	,
and	O
the	O
rest	O
consigned	O
to	O
the	O
subordinate	O
tribunals	;
that	O
the	O
supreme	O
court	O
will	O
possess	O
an	O
appellate	O
jurisdiction	,
both	O
as	O
to	O
law	O
and	O
fact	,
in	O
all	O
the	O
cases	O
referred	O
to	O
them	,
both	O
subject	O
to	O
any	O
exceptions	O
and	O
regulations	O
which	O
may	O
be	O
thought	O
advisable	;
that	O
this	O
appellate	O
jurisdiction	O
does	,
in	O
no	O
case	,
abolish	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
jury	;
and	O
that	O
an	O
ordinary	O
degree	O
of	O
prudence	O
and	O
integrity	O
in	O
the	O
national	O
councils	O
will	O
insure	O
us	O
solid	O
advantages	O
from	O
the	O
establishment	O
of	O
the	O
proposed	O
judiciary	,
without	O
exposing	O
us	O
to	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
inconveniences	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
predicted	O
from	O

source	.

<bos>	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
new	O
york	:

<bos>	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
mentioned	O
as	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
advantages	O
to	O
be	O
expected	O
from	O
the	O
co-operation	O
of	O
the	O
senate	,
in	O
the	O
business	O
of	O
appointments	,
that	O
it	O
would	O
contribute	O
to	O
the	O
stability	O
of	O
the	O
administration	.
the	O
consent	O
of	O
that	O
body	O
would	O
be	O
necessary	O
to	O
displace	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
to	O
appoint	.
a	O
change	O
of	O
the	O
chief	O
magistrate	,
therefore	,
would	O
not	O
occasion	O
so	O
violent	O
or	O
so	O
general	O
a	O
revolution	O
in	O
the	O
officers	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
as	O
might	O
be	O
expected	,
if	O
he	O
were	O
the	O
sole	O
disposer	O
of	O
offices	.
where	O
a	O
man	O
in	O
any	O
station	O
had	O
given	O
satisfactory	O
evidence	O
of	O
his	O
fitness	O
for	O
it	,
a	O
new	O
president	O
would	O
be	O
restrained	O
from	O
attempting	O
a	O
change	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
a	O
person	O
more	O
agreeable	O
to	O
him	,
by	O
the	O
apprehension	O
that	O
a	O
discountenance	O
of	O
the	O
senate	O
might	O
frustrate	O
the	O
attempt	,
and	O
bring	O
some	O
degree	O
of	O
discredit	O
upon	O
himself	.
those	O
who	O
can	O
best	O
estimate	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
a	O
steady	O
administration	,
will	O
be	O
most	O
disposed	O
to	O
prize	O
a	O
provision	O
which	O
connects	O
the	O
official	O
existence	O
of	O
public	O
men	O
with	O
the	O
approbation	O
or	O
disapprobation	O
of	O
that	O
body	O
which	,
from	O
the	O
greater	O
permanency	O
of	O
its	O
own	O
composition	,
will	O
in	O
all	O
probability	O
be	O
less	O
subject	O
to	O
inconstancy	O
than	O
any	O
other	O
member	O
of	O
the	O
government	.

<bos>	O
to	O
this	O
union	O
of	O
the	O
senate	O
with	O
the	O
president	,
in	O
the	O
article	O
of	O
appointments	,
it	O
has	O
in	O
some	O
cases	O
been	O
suggested	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
serve	O
to	O
give	O
the	O
president	O
an	O
undue	O
influence	O
over	O
the	O
senate	,
and	O
in	O
others	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
an	O
opposite	O
tendency	,
a	O
strong	O
proof	O
that	O
neither	O
suggestion	O
is	O
true	.

<bos>	O
to	O
state	O
the	O
first	O
in	O
its	O
proper	O
form	,
is	O
to	O
refute	O
it	.
it	O
amounts	O
to	O
this	:
the	O
president	O
would	O
have	O
an	O
improper	O
influence	O
over	O
the	O
senate	,
because	O
the	O
senate	O
would	O
have	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
restraining	O
him	.
this	O
is	O
an	O
absurdity	O
in	O
terms	.
it	O
can	O
not	O
admit	O
of	O
a	O
doubt	O
that	O
the	O
entire	O
power	O
of	O
appointment	O
would	O
enable	O
him	O
much	O
more	O
effectually	O
to	O
establish	O
a	O
dangerous	O
empire	O
over	O
that	O
body	,
than	O
a	O
mere	O
power	O
of	O
nomination	O
subject	O
to	O
their	O
control	.

<bos>	O
let	O
us	O
take	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
converse	O
of	O
the	O
proposition	:
``	O
the	O
senate	O
would	O
influence	O
the	O
executive	.
''	O
as	O
i	O
have	O
had	O
occasion	O
to	O
remark	O
in	O
several	O
other	O
instances	,
the	O
indistinctness	O
of	O
the	O
objection	O
forbids	O
a	O
precise	O
answer	.
in	O
what	O
manner	O
is	O

in	O
the	O

a	O
power	O

how	O
could	O
the	O

upon	O

by	O
the	O
manner	O

the	O
power	O

more	O

the	O
most	O
that	O
the	O

can	O
know	,
is	O
that	O
the	O
governor	O
claims	O
the	O

that	O
two	O

the	O

of	O
a	O

only	O

the	O
subjects	O
of	O
speculation	O

conjecture	.

<bos>	O
every	O
mere	O
council	O
of	O
appointment	,
however	O
constituted	,
will	O
be	O
a	O
conclave	,
in	O
which	O
cabal	O

will	O
have	O
their	O
full	O
scope	.
their	O
number	,
without	O
an	O

his	O
friends	O

connections	O
to	O
provide	O
for	,
the	O
desire	O

the	O

to	O
satisfy	O
the	O
private	O
attachments	O
of	O
a	O
dozen	,

of	O
twenty	O
men	,
would	O
occasion	O
a	O

all	O
the	O
principal	O
employments	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
in	O
a	O

would	O

than	O
any	O
measure	O
that	O

if	,
to	O

an	O

of	O

a	O
frequent	O
change	O
in	O
the	O
persons	O
who	O
were	O
to	O

the	O

the	O
mischiefs	O
of	O
a	O
mutable	O
administration	O
in	O
their	O
full	O
extent	.
such	O
a	O
council	O
would	O
also	O
be	O
more	O
liable	O
to	O
executive	O
influence	O
than	O
the	O
senate	,
because	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
fewer	O
in	O
number	,
and	O
would	O
act	O
less	O
immediately	O
under	O
the	O

such	O
a	O
council	,
in	O
fine	,
as	O
a	O
substitute	O
for	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	,
would	O
be	O
productive	O
of	O
an	O
increase	O
of	O
expense	,
a	O
multiplication	O
of	O
the	O
evils	O
which	O
spring	O
from	O
favoritism	O
and	O
intrigue	O
in	O
the	O
distribution	O
of	O
public	O
honors	,
a	O
decrease	O
of	O
stability	O
in	O
the	O

a	O
diminution	O
of	O
the	O
security	O
against	O
an	O
undue	O
influence	O
of	O
the	O
executive	.
and	O
yet	O
such	O
a	O
council	O
has	O
been	O
warmly	O
contended	O
for	O
as	O
an	O
essential	O
amendment	O
in	O

a	O

appear	O

it	O

of	O
the	O

both	O
of	O
the	O

of	O

be	O
defeated	O
by	O
this	O

infinite	O
delays	O

the	O
example	O
of	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
states	O
in	O
their	O

us	O
to	O

the	O
idea	.

<bos>	O
the	O
only	O

powers	O
of	O

in	O
giving	O

in	O
recommending	O

i	O
shall	O
barely	O
remark	,
that	O
in	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
senate	O
at	O

we	O
can	O
readily	O
discover	O
a	O
good	O
reason	O
for	O
it	.
as	O
this	O
body	O
has	O
a	O
concurrent	O
power	O
with	O
the	O
executive	O
in	O
the	O
article	O
of	O

it	O
might	O
often	O
be	O
necessary	O
to	O
call	O
it	O
together	O
with	O
a	O
view	O
to	O
this	O
object	,
when	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
unnecessary	O
and	O
improper	O
to	O
convene	O
the	O
house	O
of	O

as	O
to	O
the	O
reception	O
of	O
ambassadors	,
what	O
i	O
have	O
said	O
in	O
a	O
former	O
paper	O
will	O
furnish	O
a	O
sufficient	O
answer	.

<bos>	O
we	O
have	O
now	O
completed	O
a	O
survey	O
of	O
the	O
structure	O
and	O
powers	O
of	O
the	O

department	,
which	,
i	O
have	O
endeavored	O
to	O
show	,
combines	,
as	O

as	O
republican	O
principles	O
will	O
admit	,
all	O
the	O
requisites	O
to	O
energy	.
the	O
remaining	O
inquiry	O
is	:
does	O
it	O
also	O
combine	O
the	O
requisites	O
to	O
safety	,
in	O
a	O
republican	O
sense	,
a	O
due	O
dependence	O
on	O
the	O
people	,
a	O
due	O
responsibility	?
the	O
answer	O
to	O
this	O
question	O
has	O
been	O
anticipated	O
in	O
the	O
investigation	O
of	O
its	O
other	O
characteristics	,

is	O
satisfactorily	O
deducible	O
from	O

from	O
the	O

in	O
four	O

by	O
persons	O
immediately	O
chosen	O
by	O

from	O
his	O
being	O
at	O
all	O

liable	O
to	O
impeachment	,

from	O

the	O

unfortunately	O
for	O

the	O
question	O
admits	O
of	O
a	O
more	O

answer	.
there	O
are	O
causes	O
of	O

within	O

of	O
the	O

of	O
which	,
even	O
under	O
the	O

of	O

we	O
have	O

of	O
what	O
might	O

if	O
those	O

<bos>	O
territorial	O

have	O
at	O

one	O
of	O
the	O

perhaps	O
the	O

of	O

that	O

sprung	O
from	O
this	O

this	O

would	O
exist	O
among	O
us	O
in	O

we	O

there	O

claims	O
between	O
several	O
of	O
them	,
and	O
the	O
dissolution	O
of	O

would	O
lay	O
a	O
foundation	O
for	O

claims	O
between	O

all	.
it	O
is	O
well	O
known	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
heretofore	O
had	O
serious	O
and	O
animated	O
discussion	O
concerning	O
the	O
rights	O
to	O
the	O
lands	O
which	O
were	O
ungranted	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
the	O

which	O
usually	O
went	O
under	O

the	O

within	O
the	O

of	O
whose	O
colonial	O
governments	O
they	O
were	O
comprised	O
have	O
claimed	O
them	O
as	O
their	O
property	,
the	O

have	O
contended	O
that	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
the	O

in	O
this	O
article	O
devolved	O
upon	O
the	O

especially	O

either	O
by	O

through	O

of	O

was	O

this	,
it	O
has	O
been	O
said	,
was	O
at	O
all	O
events	O
an	O
acquisition	O
to	O
the	O
confederacy	O
by	O
compact	O
with	O
a	O
foreign	O
power	.
it	O
has	O
been	O
the	O
prudent	O
policy	O
of	O
congress	O
to	O
appease	O
this	O
controversy	,
by	O
prevailing	O
upon	O
the	O
states	O
to	O
make	O
cessions	O
to	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
for	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
the	O
whole	.
this	O
has	O
been	O
so	O
far	O
accomplished	O
as	,
under	O
a	O
continuation	O
of	O
the	O
union	,
to	O
afford	O
a	O
decided	O
prospect	O
of	O
an	O
amicable	O
termination	O
of	O
the	O
dispute	.
a	O
dismemberment	O
of	O
the	O
confederacy	,
however	,
would	O
revive	O
this	O
dispute	,
and	O
would	O
create	O
others	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
subject	.
at	O
present	,
a	O
large	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
vacant	O
western	O
territory	O
is	,
by	O
cession	O
at	O
least	,
if	O
not	O
by	O
any	O
anterior	O
right	,
the	O
common	O
property	O
of	O
the	O

if	O
that	O
were	O
at	O
an	O
end	,
the	O
states	O
which	O
made	O
the	O
cession	,
on	O
a	O
principle	O
of	O
federal	O
compromise	,
would	O
be	O
apt	O
when	O
the	O
motive	O
of	O
the	O
grant	O
had	O
ceased	,
to	O
reclaim	O
the	O
lands	O
as	O
a	O
reversion	.
the	O
other	O
states	O
would	O
no	O
doubt	O
insist	O
on	O
a	O
proportion	,
by	O
right	O
of	O
representation	.
their	O
argument	O
would	O
be	,
that	O
a	O
grant	,
once	O
made	,
could	O
not	O
be	O
revoked	;
and	O
that	O
the	O
justice	O
of	O
participating	O
in	O
territory	O
acquired	O
or	O
secured	O
by	O
the	O
joint	O
efforts	O
of	O
the	O
confederacy	,
remained	O
undiminished	.
if	,
contrary	O
to	O
probability	,
it	O
should	O
be	O
admitted	O
by	O
all	O
the	O
states	,
that	O
each	O
had	O
a	O
right	O
to	O
a	O
share	O
of	O
this	O
common	O
stock	,
there	O
would	O
still	O
be	O
a	O
difficulty	O
to	O
be	O
surmounted	,
as	O
to	O
a	O
proper	O
rule	O
of	O
apportionment	.
different	O
principles	O
would	O
be	O
set	O
up	O
by	O
different	O
states	O
for	O
this	O
purpose	;
and	O
as	O
they	O
would	O
affect	O
the	O
opposite	O

of	O
the	O

they	O
might	O
not	O

of	O

adjustment	.

<bos>	O
in	O
the	O
wide	O
field	O
of	O
western	O
territory	,
therefore	,
we	O
perceive	O
an	O
ample	O
theatre	O
for	O
hostile	O
pretensions	,
without	O
any	O

to	O

from	O
the	O

we	O
shall	O
have	O
good	O
ground	O
to	O
apprehend	,
that	O
the	O
sword	O
would	O
sometimes	O
be	O
appealed	O
to	O
as	O
the	O
arbiter	O
of	O
their	O

of	O
the	O
dispute	O
between	O
connecticut	O

respecting	O
the	O

us	O
not	O
to	O

sanguine	O
in	O
expecting	O
an	O
easy	O
accommodation	O
of	O
such	O
differences	.
the	O

<bos>	O
those	O

the	O

of	O
the	O
controversy	O
between	O
this	O
state	O
and	O
the	O
district	O
of	O
vermont	,
can	O
vouch	O
the	O
opposition	O
we	O
experienced	,
as	O
well	O
from	O
states	O
not	O
interested	O
as	O
from	O
those	O
which	O
were	O
interested	O
in	O
the	O
claim	;
and	O
can	O
attest	O
the	O
danger	O
to	O
which	O
the	O
peace	O
of	O
the	O
confederacy	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
exposed	,
had	O
this	O
state	O
attempted	O
to	O
assert	O
its	O
rights	O
by	O
force	.
two	O
motives	O
preponderated	O
in	O
that	O
opposition	:
one	,
a	O
jealousy	O
entertained	O
of	O
our	O
future	O
power	;
and	O
the	O
other	,
the	O
interest	O
of	O
certain	O
individuals	O
of	O
influence	O
in	O
the	O
neighboring	O
states	,
who	O
had	O
obtained	O
grants	O
of	O

under	O
the	O

of	O
that	O
district	.
even	O
the	O
states	O
which	O
brought	O
forward	O
claims	,
in	O
contradiction	O
to	O
ours	,
seemed	O
more	O
solicitous	O
to	O
dismember	O
this	O
state	,
than	O
to	O
establish	O
their	O

these	O

alarmed	O
by	O
the	O
appearance	O

between	O

that	O
state	,
entered	O
deeply	O
into	O
the	O

views	.
these	O
being	O
small	O
states	,
saw	O
with	O
an	O
unfriendly	O
eye	O
the	O
perspective	O
of	O
our	O
growing	O
greatness	.
in	O
a	O
review	O
of	O
these	O
transactions	O
we	O
may	O
trace	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
causes	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
likely	O
to	O
embroil	O
the	O
states	O
with	O
each	O
other	,
if	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
their	O
unpropitious	O
destiny	O
to	O
become	O
disunited	.

<bos>	O
the	O

of	O

would	O
be	O
another	O
fruitful	O
source	O
of	O
contention	.
the	O
states	O
less	O

circumstanced	O
would	O
be	O
desirous	O
of	O
escaping	O
from	O
the	O
disadvantages	O
of	O
local	O
situation	,
and	O
of	O
sharing	O
in	O
the	O
advantages	O
of	O
their	O
more	O
fortunate	O
neighbors	.
each	O
state	,

would	O
pursue	O
a	O
system	O
of	O
commercial	O
policy	O
peculiar	O
to	O
itself	.
this	O
would	O
occasion	O
distinctions	,

exclusions	,
which	O
would	O

to	O
which	O
we	O
have	O
been	O
accustomed	O
since	O
the	O

would	O
give	O
a	O

to	O

than	O
they	O
would	O
naturally	O

part	O

has	O
left	O
no	O
occasion	O
of	O

it	O
is	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
probable	O
that	O
this	O
unbridled	O
spirit	O
would	O
pay	O
much	O
respect	O
to	O
those	O
regulations	O
of	O

which	O

might	O

to	O
their	O

the	O

one	O
side	,
the	O
efforts	O
to	O
prevent	O

them	,
on	O
the	O

would	O
naturally	O
lead	O
to	O
outrages	,

to	O

of	O
rendering	O

by	O

the	O
relative	O
situation	O
of	O

neither	O

to	O

long	O
submit	O
to	O
be	O
taxed	O
by	O

for	O

should	O
we	O
be	O
long	O
permitted	O
to	O
remain	O
in	O
the	O
quiet	O
and	O
undisturbed	O
enjoyment	O
of	O
a	O
metropolis	,
from	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
derived	O
an	O
advantage	O
so	O
odious	O
to	O
our	O

in	O
their	O

so	O
oppressive	?
should	O
we	O

preserve	O
it	O
against	O
the	O

of	O

the	O

these	O
are	O

<bos>	O
the	O

the	O

in	O
the	O

it	O
be	O
possible	O
to	O

any	O
that	O
