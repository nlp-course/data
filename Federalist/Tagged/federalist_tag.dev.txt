the	O
second	O
class	O
of	O
powers	,

of	O
those	O
which	O
regulate	O
the	O

to	O

to	O

after	O

this	O
class	O
of	O

forms	O
an	O
obvious	O
and	O
essential	O
branch	O
of	O

if	O
we	O
are	O
to	O

one	O

it	O

the	O

and	O
to	O
send	O
and	O
receive	O
ambassadors	,
speak	O
their	O
own	O
propriety	.
both	O
of	O
them	O
are	O
comprised	O
in	O
the	O
articles	O
of	O
confederation	,
with	O
this	O
difference	O
only	,
that	O
the	O
former	O
is	O
disembarrassed	,
by	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	,
of	O
an	O
exception	,
under	O
which	O
treaties	O
might	O
be	O
substantially	O
frustrated	O
by	O
regulations	O
of	O

that	O

power	O
of	O
appointing	O

receiving	O
``	O

''	O
is	O
expressly	O
and	O
very	O
properly	O
added	O
to	O
the	O
former	O
provision	O
concerning	O
ambassadors	.

<bos>	O
the	O
term	O
ambassador	,
if	O
taken	O
strictly	,
as	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
required	O
by	O
the	O
second	O
of	O
the	O
articles	O
of	O

the	O
highest	O
grade	O
only	O
of	O

and	O
excludes	O
the	O
grades	O
which	O
the	O

will	O
be	O
most	O
likely	O
to	O
prefer	,
where	O
foreign	O
embassies	O
may	O
be	O
necessary	.
and	O
under	O
no	O
latitude	O
of	O
construction	O
will	O
the	O
term	O
comprehend	O
consuls	.
yet	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
found	O
expedient	,
and	O
has	O
been	O
the	O
practice	O
of	O
congress	,
to	O
employ	O
the	O
inferior	O
grades	O
of	O
public	O
ministers	,
and	O
to	O
send	O
and	O
receive	O
consuls	.
it	O
is	O
true	,
that	O
where	O
treaties	O
of	O
commerce	O
stipulate	O
for	O
the	O
mutual	O
appointment	O
of	O
consuls	,
whose	O
functions	O
are	O
connected	O
with	O
commerce	,
the	O
admission	O
of	O
foreign	O
consuls	O
may	O
fall	O
within	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
making	O
commercial	O
treaties	;
and	O
that	O
where	O
no	O
such	O
treaties	O
exist	,
the	O
mission	O
of	O
american	O
consuls	O
into	O
foreign	O
countries	O
may	O
perhaps	O
be	O
covered	O
under	O
the	O
authority	,
given	O
by	O
the	O
ninth	O
article	O
of	O
the	O
confederation	,
to	O
appoint	O
all	O
such	O
civil	O
officers	O

may	O
be	O
necessary	O
for	O
managing	O
the	O
general	O
affairs	O
of	O

but	O
the	O
admission	O
of	O
consuls	O
into	O
the	O
united	O
states	,
where	O
no	O
previous	O

has	O
stipulated	O

have	O
improved	O
on	O
the	O
model	O

them	.
but	O
the	O
most	O
minute	O
provisions	O

by	O
the	O
defects	O
of	O
the	O

violations	O
of	O

not	O
a	O
little	O
surprise	O
those	O
who	O
have	O
paid	O
no	O
attention	O
to	O
the	O
subject	;
and	O
would	O
be	O
no	O

argument	O
in	O

of	O
the	O
new	O
constitution	,

for	O
the	O
lesser	,
than	O
the	O
more	O
obvious	O

power	O
to	O
define	O

piracies	O

felonies	O
committed	O
on	O
the	O
high	O

and	O
offenses	O
against	O
the	O
law	O
of	O

belongs	O
with	O
equal	O
propriety	O
to	O
the	O
general	O
government	,
and	O
is	O
a	O
still	O
greater	O
improvement	O
on	O
the	O
articles	O
of	O
confederation	.
these	O
articles	O
contain	O
no	O
provision	O
for	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
offenses	O
against	O
the	O
law	O
of	O
nations	;
and	O
consequently	O
leave	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
any	O
indiscreet	O
member	O
to	O
embroil	O
the	O
confederacy	O
with	O
foreign	O
nations	.

provision	O
of	O
the	O
federal	O
articles	O
on	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
piracies	O
and	O
felonies	O
extends	O
no	O
further	O
than	O
to	O
the	O
establishment	O
of	O
courts	O
for	O
the	O
trial	O
of	O
these	O
offenses	.
the	O
definition	O
of	O
piracies	O
might	,
perhaps	,
without	O
inconveniency	,
be	O
left	O
to	O
the	O
law	O
of	O
nations	;
though	O
a	O
legislative	O
definition	O
of	O
them	O
is	O
found	O
in	O
most	O
municipal	O
codes	.
a	O
definition	O
of	O
felonies	O
on	O
the	O
high	O
seas	O
is	O
evidently	O
requisite	.
felony	O
is	O
a	O
term	O
of	O
loose	O
signification	,
even	O
in	O
the	O
common	O
law	O
of	O
england	;
and	O
of	O
various	O
import	O
in	O

of	O
that	O

but	O
neither	O
the	O
common	O
nor	O
the	O
statute	O
law	O
of	O
that	,
or	O
of	O
any	O
other	O
nation	,
ought	O
to	O
be	O

meaning	O
of	O
the	O
term	,
as	O
defined	O
in	O
the	O
codes	O
of	O
the	O
several	O
states	,
would	O
be	O
as	O
impracticable	O
as	O
the	O

a	O
dishonorable	O

guide	.
it	O
is	O
not	O
precisely	O
the	O

in	O
any	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
states	;

varies	O
in	O
each	O
with	O
every	O
revision	O
of	O
its	O
criminal	O
laws	.
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
certainty	O
and	O
uniformity	,
therefore	,
the	O
power	O
of	O
defining	O

was	O
in	O

additional	O
proofs	O
here	O
of	O
its	O

properly	O

to	O
the	O
federal	O

it	O
were	O
doubtless	O
to	O
be	O
wished	,
that	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
prohibiting	O
the	O
importation	O
of	O
slaves	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
postponed	O
until	O
the	O
year	O
1808	,
or	O
rather	O
that	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
suffered	O
to	O
have	O
immediate	O
operation	.
but	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
difficult	O
to	O
account	,
either	O
for	O
this	O
restriction	O
on	O
the	O
general	O
government	,
or	O
for	O
the	O
manner	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
whole	O
clause	O
is	O
expressed	.
it	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
a	O
great	O
point	O
gained	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
humanity	,
that	O
a	O
period	O
of	O
twenty	O
years	O
may	O
terminate	O
forever	,
within	O
these	O
states	,

has	O
so	O
long	O

so	O
loudly	O
upbraided	O

that	O
period	,
it	O
will	O
receive	O
a	O
considerable	O
discouragement	O
from	O

been	O
made	O
to	O
pervert	O
this	O
clause	O
into	O
an	O
objection	O
against	O
the	O

by	O
representing	O
it	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
as	O
a	O
criminal	O
toleration	O
of	O
an	O
illicit	O
practice	,

on	O

as	O
calculated	O
to	O
prevent	O

emigrations	O
from	O

the	O

a	O
cursory	O
review	O
of	O
the	O
remaining	O
powers	O
comprehended	O
under	O
this	O
third	O
description	,
to	O
wit	:
to	O
regulate	O
commerce	O
among	O
the	O
several	O
states	O
and	O
the	O
indian	O
tribes	;
to	O
coin	O
money	,
regulate	O
the	O
value	O
thereof	,
and	O
of	O
foreign	O
coin	;
to	O
provide	O
for	O
the	O
punishment	O
of	O
counterfeiting	O
the	O
current	O
coin	O
and	O
secureties	O
of	O
the	O
united	O

to	O
fix	O
the	O
standard	O
of	O

to	O
establish	O
a	O
uniform	O
rule	O
of	O
naturalization	,
and	O
uniform	O
laws	O
of	O

the	O

in	O
which	O
the	O
public	O
acts	,

and	O
judicial	O
proceedings	O
of	O
each	O
state	O
shall	O
be	O
proved	,
and	O
the	O
effect	O
they	O
shall	O
have	O
in	O
other	O

and	O
to	O
establish	O
post	O

the	O
defect	O
of	O
power	O
in	O
the	O
existing	O
confederacy	O
to	O
regulate	O
the	O
commerce	O
between	O
its	O
several	O
members	,

in	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
those	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
clearly	O
pointed	O
out	O
by	O
experience	.

to	O
the	O
proofs	O
and	O
remarks	O
which	O
former	O
papers	O
have	O
brought	O
into	O
view	O
on	O
this	O
subject	,
it	O
may	O
be	O
added	O
that	O
without	O
this	O
supplemental	O
provision	,
the	O
great	O
and	O
essential	O
power	O
of	O
regulating	O
foreign	O
commerce	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
incomplete	O
and	O
ineffectual	.
a	O
very	O
material	O
object	O
of	O
this	O
power	O
was	O
the	O
relief	O
of	O
the	O
states	O
which	O
import	O
and	O
export	O
through	O
other	O
states	,
from	O
the	O
improper	O
contributions	O
levied	O
on	O
them	O
by	O
the	O

these	O
at	O
liberty	O
to	O
regulate	O
the	O
trade	O
between	O
state	O
and	O
state	,
it	O
must	O
be	O
foreseen	O
that	O
ways	O

be	O
found	O
out	O
to	O

the	O
articles	O
of	O
import	O

export	,
during	O
the	O
passage	O

which	O
would	O
fall	O
on	O
the	O
makers	O
of	O
the	O
latter	O
and	O
the	O
consumers	O
of	O
the	O
former	.
we	O
may	O
be	O
assured	O
by	O
past	O
experience	,
that	O
such	O
a	O
practice	O
would	O
be	O
introduced	O
by	O
future	O
contrivances	;
and	O
both	O
by	O
that	O
and	O
a	O
common	O
knowledge	O
of	O
human	O
affairs	,
that	O
it	O
would	O
nourish	O
unceasing	O
animosities	,
and	O
not	O
improbably	O
terminate	O
in	O
serious	O
interruptions	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
tranquillity	.

<bos>	O
to	O
those	O
who	O
do	O
not	O
view	O
the	O
question	O
through	O
the	O
medium	O
of	O

of	O

any	O
form	,
an	O
indirect	O
revenue	O
from	O
their	O
uncommercial	O
neighbors	,
must	O
appear	O
not	O
less	O
impolitic	O
than	O
it	O
is	O
unfair	;
since	O
it	O
would	O
stimulate	O
the	O
injured	O
party	,
by	O
resentment	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
interest	,
to	O
resort	O
to	O
less	O

politic	,

what	O

to	O
this	O
propensity	,

the	O
alteration	O

the	O
result	O

that	O
the	O
dismission	O
of	O
his	O

has	O
proceeded	O
from	O
a	O
dislike	O

these	O
considerations	,

the	O
influence	O

<bos>	O
one	O
ill	O
effect	O

be	O

with	O
the	O

a	O
guard	O
upon	O
his	O
avarice	.
add	O
to	O
this	O
that	O
the	O
same	O
man	O
might	O
be	O
vain	O
or	O
ambitious	,
as	O
well	O
as	O
avaricious	.
and	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
expect	O
to	O
prolong	O
his	O
honors	O
by	O
his	O
good	O
conduct	,
he	O
might	O
hesitate	O
to	O
sacrifice	O
his	O
appetite	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
his	O
appetite	O
for	O
gain	.
but	O
with	O
the	O
prospect	O
before	O
him	O
of	O
approaching	O
an	O
inevitable	O
annihilation	,
his	O
avarice	O
would	O
be	O
likely	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
victory	O
over	O
his	O
caution	,
his	O
vanity	,
or	O
his	O
ambition	.

<bos>	O
an	O
ambitious	O
man	,
too	,
when	O
he	O
found	O
himself	O
seated	O
on	O
the	O
summit	O
of	O
his	O
country	O
's	O
honors	,
when	O
he	O
looked	O
forward	O
to	O
the	O
time	O
at	O
which	O
he	O
must	O
descend	O
from	O
the	O
exalted	O
eminence	O
for	O
ever	,
and	O
reflected	O
that	O
no	O
exertion	O
of	O
merit	O
on	O
his	O
part	O
could	O
save	O
him	O
from	O
the	O
unwelcome	O
reverse	;
such	O
a	O
man	,
in	O
such	O
a	O
situation	,
would	O
be	O
much	O
more	O
violently	O
tempted	O
to	O
embrace	O
a	O
favorable	O
conjuncture	O
for	O
attempting	O
the	O
prolongation	O
of	O
his	O
power	,
at	O
every	O
personal	O
hazard	,
than	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
probability	O
of	O
answering	O
the	O
same	O
end	O
by	O
doing	O
his	O
duty	.

<bos>	O
would	O
it	O
promote	O
the	O
peace	O
of	O
the	O
community	,
or	O
the	O
stability	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
to	O
have	O
half	O
a	O
dozen	O
men	O
who	O
had	O
had	O
credit	O
enough	O
to	O
be	O
raised	O
to	O
the	O
seat	O
of	O
the	O
supreme	O
magistracy	,
wandering	O
among	O
the	O
people	O
like	O
discontented	O
ghosts	,
and	O
sighing	O
for	O
a	O
place	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
destined	O
never	O
more	O
to	O
possess	?

<bos>	O
a	O
third	O
ill	O
effect	O
of	O
the	O
exclusion	O
would	O
be	,
the	O
depriving	O
the	O
community	O
of	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
the	O
experience	O
gained	O
by	O
the	O
chief	O
magistrate	O
in	O
the	O
exercise	O
of	O
his	O
office	.
that	O
experience	O
is	O
the	O
parent	O
of	O
wisdom	,
is	O
an	O
adage	O
the	O
truth	O
of	O
which	O
is	O
recognized	O
by	O
the	O
wisest	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
simplest	O
of	O
mankind	.
what	O
more	O
desirable	O
or	O
more	O
essential	O
than	O
this	O
quality	O
in	O
the	O
governors	O
of	O
nations	?
where	O
more	O
desirable	O
or	O
more	O
essential	O
than	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
magistrate	O
of	O
a	O
nation	?
can	O
it	O
be	O
wise	O
to	O
put	O
this	O
desirable	O
and	O
essential	O
quality	O
under	O
the	O
ban	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	,
and	O
to	O
declare	O
that	O
the	O
moment	O
it	O
is	O
acquired	,
its	O
possessor	O
shall	O
be	O
compelled	O
to	O
abandon	O
the	O
station	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
acquired	,
and	O
to	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
adapted	?
this	,
nevertheless	,
is	O
the	O
precise	O
import	O
of	O
all	O
those	O
regulations	O
which	O
exclude	O
men	O
from	O
serving	O
their	O
country	,
by	O
the	O
choice	O
of	O
their	O
fellowcitizens	,
after	O
they	O
have	O
by	O
a	O
course	O
of	O
service	O
fitted	O
themselves	O
for	O
doing	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
greater	O
degree	O
of	O
utility	.

<bos>	O
a	O
fourth	O
ill	O
effect	O
of	O
the	O
exclusion	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
banishing	O
men	O
from	O
stations	O
in	O
which	,
in	O
certain	O
emergencies	O
of	O
the	O
state	,
their	O
presence	O
might	O
be	O
of	O
the	O
greatest	O
moment	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
interest	O
or	O
safety	.
there	O
is	O
no	O
nation	O
which	O
has	O
not	,
at	O
one	O
period	O
or	O
another	,
experienced	O
an	O
absolute	O
necessity	O
of	O
the	O
services	O
of	O
particular	O
men	O
in	O
particular	O
situations	;
perhaps	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
too	O
strong	O
to	O
say	,
to	O
the	O
preservation	O
of	O
its	O
political	O
existence	.
how	O
unwise	,
therefore	,
must	O
be	O
every	O
such	O
self-denying	O
ordinance	O
as	O
serves	O
to	O
prohibit	O
a	O
nation	O
from	O
making	O
use	O
of	O
its	O
own	O
citizens	O
in	O
the	O
manner	O
best	O
suited	O
to	O
its	O
exigencies	O
and	O
circumstances	!
without	O
supposing	O
the	O
personal	O
essentiality	O
of	O
the	O
man	,
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
a	O
change	O
of	O
the	O
chief	O
magistrate	,
at	O
the	O
breaking	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
war	,
or	O
at	O
any	O
similar	O
crisis	,
for	O
another	,
even	O
of	O
equal	O
merit	,
would	O
at	O
all	O
times	O
be	O
detrimental	O
to	O
the	O
community	,
inasmuch	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
substitute	O
inexperience	O
to	O
experience	,
and	O
would	O
tend	O
to	O
unhinge	O
and	O
set	O
afloat	O
the	O
already	O
settled	O
train	O
of	O
the	O
administration	.

<bos>	O
a	O
fifth	O
ill	O
effect	O
of	O
the	O
exclusion	O
would	O
be	,
that	O
it	O
would	O
operate	O
as	O
a	O
constitutional	O
interdiction	O
of	O
stability	O
in	O
the	O
administration	.
by	O
necessitating	O
a	O
change	O
of	O
men	,
in	O
the	O
first	O
office	O
of	O
the	O
nation	,
it	O
would	O
necessitate	O
a	O
mutability	O
of	O
measures	.
it	O
is	O
not	O
generally	O
to	O
be	O
expected	,
that	O
men	O
will	O
vary	O
and	O
measures	O
remain	O
uniform	.
the	O
contrary	O
is	O
the	O
usual	O
course	O
of	O
things	.
and	O
we	O
need	O
not	O
be	O
apprehensive	O
that	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
too	O
much	O
stability	,
while	O
there	O
is	O
even	O
the	O
option	O
of	O
changing	;
nor	O
need	O
we	O
desire	O
to	O
prohibit	O
the	O
people	O
from	O
continuing	O
their	O
confidence	O
where	O
they	O
think	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
safely	O
placed	,
and	O
where	,
by	O
constancy	O
on	O
their	O
part	,
they	O
may	O
obviate	O
the	O
fatal	O
inconveniences	O
of	O
fluctuating	O
councils	O
and	O
a	O
variable	O
policy	.

<bos>	O
these	O
are	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
disadvantages	O
which	O
would	O
flow	O
from	O
the	O
principle	O
of	O
exclusion	.
they	O
apply	O
most	O
forcibly	O
to	O
the	O
scheme	O
of	O
a	O
perpetual	O
exclusion	;
but	O
when	O
we	O
consider	O
that	O
even	O
a	O
partial	O
exclusion	O
would	O
always	O
render	O
the	O
readmission	O
of	O
the	O
person	O
a	O
remote	O
and	O
precarious	O
object	,
the	O
observations	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
made	O
will	O
apply	O
nearly	O
as	O
fully	O
to	O
one	O
case	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
other	.

<bos>	O
what	O
are	O
the	O
advantages	O
promised	O
to	O
counterbalance	O
these	O
disadvantages	?
they	O
are	O
represented	O
to	O
be	:
1st	,
greater	O
independence	O
in	O
the	O
magistrate	;
2d	,
greater	O
security	O
to	O
the	O
people	.
unless	O
the	O
exclusion	O
be	O
perpetual	,
there	O
will	O
be	O
no	O
pretense	O
to	O
infer	O
the	O
first	O
advantage	.
but	O
even	O
in	O
that	O
case	,
may	O
he	O
have	O
no	O
object	O
beyond	O
his	O
present	O
station	,
to	O
which	O
he	O
may	O
sacrifice	O
his	O
independence	?
may	O
he	O
have	O
no	O
connections	,
no	O
friends	,
for	O
whom	O
he	O
may	O
sacrifice	O
it	?
may	O
he	O
not	O
be	O
less	O
willing	O
by	O
a	O
firm	O
conduct	,
to	O
make	O
personal	O
enemies	,
when	O
he	O
acts	O
under	O
the	O
impression	O
that	O
a	O
time	O
is	O
fast	O
approaching	,
on	O
the	O
arrival	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
not	O
only	O
may	,
but	O
must	,
be	O
exposed	O
to	O
their	O
resentments	,
upon	O
an	O
equal	,
perhaps	O
upon	O
an	O
inferior	,
footing	?
it	O
is	O
not	O
an	O
easy	O
point	O
to	O
determine	O
whether	O
his	O
independence	O
would	O
be	O
most	O
promoted	O
or	O
impaired	O
by	O
such	O
an	O
arrangement	.

<bos>	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
second	O
supposed	O
advantage	,
there	O
is	O
still	O
greater	O
reason	O
to	O
entertain	O
doubts	O
concerning	O
it	.
if	O
the	O
exclusion	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
perpetual	,
a	O
man	O
of	O
irregular	O
ambition	,
of	O
whom	O
alone	O
there	O
could	O
be	O
reason	O
in	O
any	O
case	O
to	O
entertain	O
apprehension	,
would	,
with	O
infinite	O
reluctance	,
yield	O
to	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
taking	O
his	O
leave	O
forever	O
of	O
a	O
post	O
in	O
which	O
his	O
passion	O
for	O
power	O
and	O
pre-eminence	O
had	O
acquired	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
habit	.
and	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
fortunate	O
or	O
adroit	O
enough	O
to	O
conciliate	O
the	O
good-will	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
he	O
might	O
induce	O
them	O
to	O
consider	O
as	O
a	O
very	O
odious	O
and	O
unjustifiable	O
restraint	O
upon	O
themselves	,
a	O
provision	O
which	O
was	O
calculated	O
to	O
debar	O
them	O
of	O
the	O
right	O
of	O
giving	O
a	O
fresh	O
proof	O
of	O
their	O
attachment	O
to	O
a	O
favorite	.
there	O
may	O
be	O
conceived	O
circumstances	O
in	O
which	O
this	O
disgust	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
seconding	O
the	O
thwarted	O
ambition	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
favorite	,
might	O
occasion	O
greater	O
danger	O
to	O
liberty	,
than	O
could	O
ever	O
reasonably	O
be	O
dreaded	O
from	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
a	O
perpetuation	O
in	O
office	,
by	O
the	O
voluntary	O
suffrages	O
of	O
the	O
community	,
exercising	O
a	O
constitutional	O
privilege	.

<bos>	O
there	O
is	O
an	O
excess	O
of	O
refinement	O
in	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
disabling	O
the	O
people	O
to	O
continue	O
in	O
office	O
men	O
who	O
had	O
entitled	O
themselves	,
in	O
their	O
opinion	,
to	O
approbation	O
and	O
confidence	;
the	O
advantages	O
of	O
which	O
are	O
at	O
best	O
speculative	O
and	O
equivocal	,
and	O
are	O
overbalanced	O
by	O
disadvantages	O
far	O
more	O
certain	O
and	O
decisive	.

<bos>	O
the	O
importance	O
of	O
the	O
union	,
in	O
a	O
commercial	O
light	,
is	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
points	O
about	O
which	O
there	O
is	O
least	O
room	O
to	O
entertain	O
a	O
difference	O
of	O
opinion	,
and	O
which	O
has	,
in	O
fact	,
commanded	O
the	O
most	O
general	O
assent	O
of	O
men	O
who	O
have	O
any	O
acquaintance	O
with	O
the	O
subject	.
this	O
applies	O
as	O
well	O
to	O
our	O
intercourse	O
with	O
foreign	O
countries	O
as	O
with	O
each	O
other	.

<bos>	O
there	O
are	O
appearances	O
to	O
authorize	O
a	O
supposition	O
that	O
the	O
adventurous	O
spirit	,
which	O
distinguishes	O
the	O
commercial	O
character	O
of	O
america	,
has	O
already	O
excited	O
uneasy	O
sensations	O
in	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
maritime	O
powers	O
of	O
europe	.
they	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
apprehensive	O
of	O
our	O
too	O
great	O
interference	O
in	O
that	O
carrying	O
trade	,
which	O
is	O
the	O
support	O
of	O
their	O
navigation	O

of	O

naval	O
strength	.
those	O

forward	O
to	O
what	O
this	O

the	O
dangers	O
that	O

indicate	O
the	O
policy	O

of	O
an	O

this	O
would	O
answer	O
the	O
threefold	O
purpose	O
of	O
preventing	O
our	O
interference	O
in	O
their	O
navigation	,
of	O
monopolizing	O
the	O

this	O
policy	O

<bos>	O
if	O
we	O
continue	O
united	,
we	O
may	O
counteract	O
a	O
policy	O
so	O
unfriendly	O
to	O
our	O
prosperity	O
in	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
ways	.
by	O
prohibitory	O
regulations	,
extending	,
at	O
the	O

for	O
the	O

this	O

in	O

her	O

<bos>	O
a	O
mature	O
consideration	O
of	O
the	O

the	O
american	O

with	O

the	O
west	O

would	O
produce	O
a	O
relaxation	O

from	O

expected	O
without	O
an	O
equivalent	O
in	O

in	O

be	O
likely	O
to	O
have	O
a	O

effect	O
on	O
the	O

of	O

would	O

<bos>	O
a	O

for	O
influencing	O
the	O
conduct	O
of	O

toward	O
us	,
in	O
this	O

would	O
arise	O
from	O
the	O

no	O

that	O
the	O

would	O
put	O
it	O
in	O

at	O
a	O
period	O
not	O

distant	,
to	O
create	O
a	O

which	,
if	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
vie	O
with	O
those	O
of	O

would	O
at	O

be	O
of	O

weight	O
if	O
thrown	O
into	O
the	O
scale	O
of	O
either	O
of	O

this	O
would	O
be	O

sent	O
opportunely	O
to	O

of	O

to	O

the	O

of	O
a	O

on	O
the	O
event	O
of	O
which	O

our	O

it	O
will	O
readily	O
be	O
perceived	O
that	O

would	O
enable	O
us	O
to	O
bargain	O
with	O

a	O

would	O
be	O

not	O

upon	O
our	O

by	O
a	O
steady	O
adherence	O
to	O
the	O

we	O
may	O
hope	,
erelong	,
to	O
become	O
the	O
arbiter	O
of	O
europe	O
in	O

to	O

in	O
the	O

of	O
this	O

we	O
shall	O
discover	O
that	O
the	O

in	O

the	O

<bos>	O
it	O
may	O

be	O
replied	O
to	O
this	,
that	O
whether	O
the	O

the	O

this	O

would	O
be	O
fettered	,
interrupted	,

by	O
a	O

a	O

it	O

that	O
much	O
of	O
the	O

its	O

i	O
frankly	O
acknowledge	O
to	O
you	O
my	O
convictions	,
and	O
i	O
will	O
freely	O

before	O

i	O
shall	O
not	,

professions	O
on	O
this	O

my	O
motives	O
must	O
remain	O
in	O
the	O
depository	O
of	O
my	O

my	O
arguments	O
will	O
be	O
open	O
to	O

by	O

at	O

be	O
offered	O
in	O
a	O
spirit	O
which	O
will	O
not	O
disgrace	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
truth	.

<bos>	O
i	O
propose	,
in	O
a	O
series	O
of	O
papers	,
to	O
discuss	O
the	O
following	O
interesting	O
particulars	:

<bos>	O
the	O
utility	O
of	O
the	O
union	O
to	O
your	O
political	O
prosperity	O
the	O
insufficiency	O
of	O
the	O
present	O
confederation	O
to	O
preserve	O
that	O
union	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
a	O
government	O
at	O
least	O
equally	O
energetic	O
with	O
the	O
one	O
proposed	,
to	O
the	O
attainment	O
of	O
this	O
object	O
the	O
conformity	O
of	O
the	O
proposed	O
constitution	O
to	O
the	O
true	O
principles	O
of	O
republican	O
government	O
its	O
analogy	O
to	O
your	O
own	O
state	O
constitution	O
and	O
lastly	,
the	O
additional	O
security	O
which	O
its	O
adoption	O
will	O
afford	O
to	O
the	O
preservation	O
of	O
that	O
species	O
of	O
government	,
to	O
liberty	,
and	O
to	O
property	.

<bos>	O
in	O
the	O
progress	O
of	O
this	O
discussion	O
i	O
shall	O
endeavor	O
to	O
give	O
a	O
satisfactory	O
answer	O
to	O
all	O
the	O
objections	O
which	O
shall	O
have	O
made	O
their	O
appearance	,
that	O
may	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
any	O
claim	O
to	O
your	O
attention	.

<bos>	O
it	O
may	O
perhaps	O
be	O
thought	O
superfluous	O
to	O
offer	O
arguments	O
to	O
prove	O
the	O
utility	O
of	O
the	O
union	,
a	O
point	,
no	O
doubt	,
deeply	O
engraved	O
on	O
the	O
hearts	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
every	O
state	,
and	O
one	,
which	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
imagined	,
has	O
no	O
adversaries	.
but	O
the	O
fact	O
is	,
that	O
we	O
already	O
hear	O
it	O
whispered	O
in	O
the	O
private	O
circles	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
oppose	O
the	O
new	O
constitution	,
that	O
the	O
thirteen	O
states	O
are	O
of	O
too	O
great	O
extent	O
for	O
any	O
general	O
system	,
and	O
that	O
we	O
must	O
of	O
necessity	O
resort	O
to	O
separate	O
confederacies	O
of	O
distinct	O
portions	O
of	O
the	O
whole.1	O
this	O
doctrine	O
will	,
in	O
all	O
probability	,
be	O
gradually	O
propagated	,
till	O
it	O
has	O
votaries	O
enough	O
to	O
countenance	O
an	O
open	O
avowal	O
of	O
it	.
for	O
nothing	O
can	O
be	O
more	O
evident	,
to	O
those	O
who	O
are	O
able	O
to	O
take	O
an	O
enlarged	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
subject	,
than	O
the	O
alternative	O
of	O
an	O
adoption	O
of	O
the	O
new	O
constitution	O
or	O
a	O
dismemberment	O
of	O
the	O
union	.
it	O
will	O
therefore	O
be	O
of	O
use	O
to	O
begin	O
by	O
examining	O
the	O
advantages	O
of	O
that	O
union	,
the	O
certain	O
evils	,
and	O
the	O
probable	O
dangers	,
to	O
which	O
every	O
state	O
will	O
be	O
exposed	O
from	O
its	O
dissolution	.
this	O
shall	O
accordingly	O
constitute	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
my	O
next	O
address	.

<bos>	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O

york	:

<bos>	O
as	O
connected	O
with	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
revenue	,
we	O
may	O
with	O
propriety	O
consider	O
that	O
of	O
economy	.
the	O
money	O
saved	O
from	O
one	O
object	O
may	O
be	O
usefully	O
applied	O
to	O
another	,
and	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
so	O
much	O
the	O
less	O
to	O
be	O
drawn	O
from	O
the	O
pockets	O
of	O
the	O
people	.
if	O
the	O
states	O
are	O
united	O
under	O
one	O
government	,
there	O
will	O
be	O
but	O
one	O
national	O
civil	O
list	O
to	O
support	;
if	O
they	O
are	O
divided	O
into	O
several	O
confederacies	,
there	O
will	O
be	O
as	O
many	O
different	O
national	O
civil	O
lists	O
to	O
be	O
provided	O
for	O
--	O
and	O
each	O
of	O
them	,
as	O
to	O
the	O
principal	O
departments	,
coextensive	O
with	O
that	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
necessary	O
for	O
a	O
government	O
of	O
the	O
whole	.
the	O
entire	O
separation	O
of	O
the	O
states	O
into	O
thirteen	O
unconnected	O
sovereignties	O
is	O
a	O
project	O
too	O
extravagant	O
and	O
too	O
replete	O
with	O
danger	O
to	O
have	O
many	O
advocates	.
the	O
ideas	O
of	O
men	O
who	O
speculate	O
upon	O
the	O
dismemberment	O
of	O
the	O
empire	O
seem	O
generally	O
turned	O
toward	O
three	O
confederacies	O
--	O
one	O
consisting	O
of	O
the	O
four	O
northern	,
another	O
of	O
the	O
four	O
middle	,
and	O
a	O
third	O
of	O
the	O
five	O
southern	O
states	.
there	O
is	O
little	O
probability	O
that	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
greater	O
number	.
according	O
to	O
this	O
distribution	,
each	O
confederacy	O
would	O
comprise	O
an	O
extent	O
of	O
territory	O
larger	O
than	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
kingdom	O
of	O
great	O
britain	.
no	O
well-informed	O
man	O
will	O
suppose	O
that	O
the	O
affairs	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
confederacy	O
can	O
be	O
properly	O
regulated	O
by	O
a	O
government	O
less	O
comprehensive	O
in	O
its	O
organs	O
or	O
institutions	O
than	O
that	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
proposed	O
by	O
the	O
convention	.
when	O
the	O
dimensions	O
of	O
a	O
state	O
attain	O
to	O
a	O
certain	O
magnitude	,
it	O
requires	O
the	O
same	O
energy	O
of	O
government	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
forms	O
of	O
administration	O
which	O
are	O
requisite	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
much	O
greater	O
extent	.
this	O
idea	O
admits	O
not	O
of	O
precise	O
demonstration	,
because	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
rule	O
by	O
which	O
we	O
can	O
measure	O
the	O
momentum	O
of	O
civil	O
power	O
necessary	O
to	O
the	O
government	O
of	O
any	O
given	O
number	O
of	O
individuals	;
but	O
when	O
we	O
consider	O
that	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
britain	,
nearly	O
commensurate	O
with	O
each	O
of	O
the	O
supposed	O
confederacies	,
contains	O
about	O
eight	O
millions	O
of	O
people	,
and	O
when	O
we	O
reflect	O
upon	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
authority	O
required	O
to	O
direct	O
the	O
passions	O
of	O
so	O
large	O
a	O
society	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
good	,
we	O
shall	O
see	O
no	O
reason	O
to	O
doubt	O
that	O
the	O
like	O
portion	O
of	O
power	O
would	O
be	O
sufficient	O
to	O
perform	O
the	O
same	O
task	O
in	O
a	O
society	O
far	O
more	O
numerous	.
civil	O
power	,
properly	O
organized	O
and	O
exerted	,
is	O
capable	O
of	O
diffusing	O
its	O
force	O
to	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
extent	;
and	O
can	,
in	O
a	O
manner	,
reproduce	O
itself	O
in	O
every	O
part	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
empire	O
by	O
a	O
judicious	O
arrangement	O
of	O
subordinate	O
institutions	.

the	O
supposition	O
that	O
each	O
confederacy	O
into	O
which	O
the	O
states	O
would	O
be	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
divided	O
would	O
require	O
a	O
government	O
not	O
less	O
comprehensive	O
than	O
the	O
one	O
proposed	,
will	O
be	O
strengthened	O
by	O
another	O
supposition	,
more	O
probable	O
than	O
that	O
which	O
presents	O
us	O
with	O
three	O
confederacies	O
as	O
the	O
alternative	O
to	O
a	O
general	O
union	.
if	O
we	O
attend	O
carefully	O
to	O
geographical	O
and	O
commercial	O
considerations	,
in	O
conjunction	O
with	O
the	O
habits	O
and	O
prejudices	O
of	O
the	O
different	O
states	,
we	O
shall	O
be	O
led	O
to	O
conclude	O
that	O
in	O
case	O
of	O
disunion	O
they	O
will	O
most	O
naturally	O
league	O
themselves	O
under	O
two	O

new	O
york	,
situated	O
as	O
she	O
is	,
would	O
never	O
be	O
unwise	O
enough	O
to	O
oppose	O
a	O
feeble	O
and	O
unsupported	O
flank	O
to	O
the	O
weight	O
of	O
that	O
confederacy	.
there	O
are	O
other	O
obvious	O
reasons	O
that	O
would	O
facilitate	O
her	O
accession	O
to	O
it	.
new	O
jersey	O
is	O
too	O
small	O
a	O
state	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
being	O
a	O
frontier	,
in	O
opposition	O
to	O
this	O
still	O
more	O
powerful	O
combination	;

do	O
there	O
appear	O
to	O
be	O
any	O
obstacles	O
to	O
her	O
admission	O
into	O
it	.

inducements	O
to	O

of	O
her	O

coincides	O
with	O
the	O
opinions	O
and	O
dispositions	O
of	O
her	O
citizens	.
the	O
more	O
southern	O
states	,
from	O

circumstances	,
may	O
not	O
think	O
themselves	O
much	O
interested	O
in	O
the	O
encouragement	O
of	O
navigation	.
they	O
may	O
prefer	O
a	O
system	O
which	O
would	O
give	O
unlimited	O
scope	O
to	O
all	O
nations	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
carriers	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
purchasers	O
of	O

pennsylvania	O
may	O
not	O
choose	O
to	O
confound	O
her	O
interests	O
in	O
a	O
connection	O
so	O
adverse	O
to	O
her	O
policy	.
as	O
she	O
must	O
at	O
all	O
events	O
be	O
a	O
frontier	,
she	O
may	O
deem	O
it	O
most	O
consistent	O
with	O
her	O
safety	O
to	O
have	O
her	O
exposed	O
side	O
turned	O
towards	O
the	O
weaker	O
power	O
of	O
the	O
southern	,
rather	O
than	O
towards	O
the	O
stronger	O
power	O
of	O
the	O
northern	,
confederacy	.
this	O
would	O
give	O
her	O
the	O
fairest	O
chance	O
to	O
avoid	O
being	O
the	O
flanders	O
of	O
america	.
whatever	O
may	O
be	O
the	O
determination	O
of	O
pennsylvania	,
if	O
the	O
northern	O
confederacy	O
includes	O
new	O
jersey	,
there	O
is	O
no	O
likelihood	O
of	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
confederacy	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
of	O
that	O
state	.

<bos>	O
nothing	O
can	O
be	O
more	O
evident	O
than	O
that	O
the	O
thirteen	O
states	O
will	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
support	O
a	O
national	O
government	O
better	O
than	O

half	,
or	O
one	O
third	,
or	O
any	O
number	O
less	O
than	O
the	O
whole	.
this	O
reflection	O
must	O
have	O
great	O
weight	O
in	O
obviating	O
that	O
objection	O
to	O
the	O
proposed	O
plan	,
which	O
is	O
founded	O
on	O
the	O
principle	O
of	O
expense	;
an	O
objection	,
however	,
which	,
when	O
we	O
come	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
nearer	O
view	O
of	O
it	,
will	O
appear	O
in	O
every	O
light	O
to	O
stand	O
on	O
mistaken	O
ground	.

<bos>	O
if	,
in	O
addition	O
to	O
the	O
consideration	O
of	O
a	O
plurality	O
of	O
civil	O
lists	,
we	O
take	O
into	O
view	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
persons	O
who	O
must	O
necessarily	O
be	O
employed	O
to	O
guard	O
the	O
inland	O
communication	O
between	O
the	O
different	O
confederacies	O
against	O
illicit	O
trade	,
and	O
who	O
in	O
time	O
will	O
infallibly	O
spring	O
up	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
necessities	O
of	O
revenue	;
and	O
if	O
we	O
also	O
take	O
into	O
view	O
the	O
military	O
establishments	O
which	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
shown	O
would	O
unavoidably	O
result	O
from	O
the	O
jealousies	O
and	O
conflicts	O
of	O
the	O
several	O
nations	O
into	O
which	O
the	O
states	O
would	O
be	O
divided	,
we	O
shall	O
clearly	O
discover	O
that	O
a	O
separation	O
would	O
be	O
not	O
less	O
injurious	O
to	O
the	O
economy	,
than	O
to	O
the	O
tranquillity	,
commerce	,

and	O
liberty	O
of	O

<bos>	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
new	O
york	:

<bos>	O
we	O
have	O
seen	,
that	O
an	O
uncontrollable	O
power	O
over	O
the	O
elections	O
to	O
the	O
federal	O
government	O
could	O
not	,
without	O
hazard	,
be	O
committed	O
to	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	.
let	O
us	O
now	O
see	,
what	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
danger	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	;
that	O
is	,
from	O
confiding	O
the	O
ultimate	O
right	O
of	O
regulating	O
its	O
own	O
elections	O
to	O
the	O
union	O
itself	.
it	O
is	O
not	O
pretended	,
that	O
this	O
right	O
would	O
ever	O
be	O
used	O
for	O
the	O
exclusion	O
of	O
any	O
state	O
from	O
its	O
share	O
in	O
the	O
representation	.
the	O
interest	O
of	O
all	O
would	,
in	O
this	O
respect	O
at	O
least	,
be	O
the	O
security	O
of	O
all	.
but	O
it	O
is	O
alleged	,
that	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
employed	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
as	O
to	O
promote	O
the	O
election	O
of	O
some	O
favorite	O
class	O
of	O
men	O
in	O
exclusion	O
of	O
others	,
by	O
confining	O
the	O
places	O
of	O
election	O
to	O
particular	O
districts	,
and	O
rendering	O
it	O
impracticable	O
to	O
the	O
citizens	O
at	O
large	O
to	O
partake	O
in	O
the	O
choice	.
of	O
all	O
chimerical	O
suppositions	,
this	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
most	O
chimerical	.
on	O
the	O
one	O
hand	,
no	O
rational	O
calculation	O
of	O
probabilities	O
would	O
lead	O
us	O
to	O
imagine	O
that	O
the	O
disposition	O
which	O
a	O
conduct	O
so	O
violent	O
and	O
extraordinary	O
would	O
imply	,
could	O
ever	O
find	O
its	O
way	O
into	O
the	O
national	O
councils	;
and	O
on	O
the	O
other	,
it	O
may	O
be	O
concluded	O
with	O
certainty	,
that	O
if	O
so	O
improper	O
a	O
spirit	O
should	O
ever	O
gain	O
admittance	O
into	O
them	,
it	O
would	O
display	O
itself	O
in	O
a	O
form	O
altogether	O
different	O
and	O
far	O
more	O
decisive	.

<bos>	O
the	O
improbability	O
of	O
the	O
attempt	O

is	O

to	O
conceive	O
that	O
this	O

in	O
certain	O

to	O
a	O
particular	O

of	O
citizens	,
by	O
a	O
victorious	O

that	O
so	O
fundamental	O
a	O
privilege	,
in	O
a	O
country	O
so	O
situated	O

should	O
be	O
invaded	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

by	O
the	O
deliberate	O
policy	O
of	O
the	O

without	O

is	O
altogether	O
inconceivable	O

what	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
object	O
of	O
this	O

that	O
the	O

and	O
i	O
scruple	O
not	O
to	O
affirm	,
that	O
it	O
is	O
infinitely	O
less	O
likely	O
that	O
either	O
of	O
them	O
should	O
gain	O
an	O
ascendant	O
in	O
the	O
national	O
councils	,
than	O
that	O
the	O
one	O
or	O
the	O
other	O
of	O
them	O
should	O
predominate	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
local	O

the	O
inference	O
will	O
be	,
that	O
a	O
conduct	O
tending	O
to	O
give	O
an	O
undue	O
preference	O
to	O
either	O
is	O
much	O
less	O
to	O

the	O
former	O

from	O
the	O
latter	.

the	O
several	O
states	O

to	O
agriculture	O

commerce	.
in	O
most	,
if	O
not	O
all	O
of	O
them	,
agriculture	O
is	O
predominant	.
in	O
a	O
few	O
of	O
them	,
however	,
commerce	O
nearly	O
divides	O
its	O
empire	,
and	O
in	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
has	O
a	O
considerable	O
share	O
of	O
influence	.
in	O
proportion	O
as	O
either	O
prevails	,
it	O
will	O
be	O
conveyed	O
into	O
the	O
national	O
representation	;
and	O
for	O
the	O
very	O
reason	,
that	O
this	O
will	O
be	O
an	O
emanation	O
from	O
a	O
greater	O
variety	O
of	O
interests	,
and	O
in	O
much	O
more	O
various	O
proportions	,
than	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
any	O
single	O
state	,
it	O
will	O
be	O
much	O
less	O
apt	O
to	O
espouse	O
either	O
of	O
them	O
with	O
a	O
decided	O
partiality	,
than	O
the	O
representation	O
of	O
any	O
single	O
state	.

<bos>	O
in	O
a	O
country	O

where	O
the	O
rules	O

the	O

must	,
upon	O
the	O

in	O
the	O
government	.
as	O
long	O
as	O
this	O
interest	O
prevails	O
in	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	,
so	O
long	O
it	O
must	O
maintain	O
a	O
correspondent	O
superiority	O
in	O
the	O
national	O
senate	,
which	O
will	O
generally	O
be	O
a	O
faithful	O
copy	O
of	O
the	O
majorities	O
of	O
those	O
assemblies	.
it	O
can	O
not	O

be	O
presumed	,
that	O
a	O
sacrifice	O
of	O
the	O

to	O
the	O

will	O
ever	O
be	O
a	O
favorite	O
object	O
of	O

in	O
applying	O
thus	O

to	O
the	O
senate	O
a	O
general	O
observation	O
suggested	O
by	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
the	O
country	,
i	O
am	O
governed	O
by	O
the	O
consideration	,
that	O
the	O
credulous	O
votaries	O
of	O
state	O
power	O
can	O
not	,
upon	O
their	O
own	O
principles	,
suspect	,
that	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	O
would	O
be	O
warped	O
from	O
their	O
duty	O
by	O
any	O
external	O
influence	.
but	O
in	O
reality	O
the	O
same	O
situation	O
must	O
have	O
the	O
same	O
effect	,
in	O
the	O
primative	O
composition	O
at	O
least	O
of	O
the	O
federal	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	:
an	O
improper	O
bias	O
towards	O
the	O
mercantile	O
class	O
is	O
as	O
little	O
to	O
be	O
expected	O
from	O
this	O
quarter	O
as	O
from	O
the	O
other	.

<bos>	O
in	O
order	,
perhaps	,
to	O
give	O
countenance	O
to	O
the	O
objection	O
at	O
any	O
rate	,
it	O
may	O
be	O
asked	,
is	O
there	O
not	O
danger	O
of	O
an	O
opposite	O
bias	O
in	O
the	O
national	O
government	,
which	O
may	O
dispose	O
it	O
to	O
endeavor	O
to	O
secure	O
a	O
monopoly	O
of	O
the	O
federal	O
administration	O
to	O
the	O
landed	O
class	?
as	O
there	O
is	O
little	O
likelihood	O
that	O
the	O
supposition	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
bias	O
will	O
have	O
any	O
terrors	O
for	O
those	O
who	O
would	O
be	O
immediately	O
injured	O
by	O
it	,
a	O
labored	O
answer	O
to	O
this	O
question	O
will	O
be	O
dispensed	O
with	.
it	O
will	O
be	O
sufficient	O
to	O
remark	,
first	,
that	O
for	O
the	O
reasons	O
elsewhere	O
assigned	,
it	O
is	O
less	O
likely	O
that	O
any	O
decided	O
partiality	O
should	O
prevail	O
in	O
the	O
councils	O
of	O
the	O
union	O
than	O
in	O
those	O
of	O
any	O
of	O
its	O
members	.
secondly	,
that	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
no	O
temptation	O
to	O
violate	O
the	O
constitution	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
the	O
landed	O
class	,
because	O
that	O
class	O
would	,
in	O
the	O
natural	O
course	O
of	O
things	,
enjoy	O
as	O
great	O
a	O
preponderancy	O
as	O
itself	O
could	O
desire	.
and	O
thirdly	,
that	O
men	O
accustomed	O
to	O
investigate	O
the	O
sources	O
of	O
public	O
prosperity	O
upon	O
a	O
large	O
scale	,
must	O
be	O
too	O
well	O
convinced	O
of	O
the	O

inclined	O
to	O

upon	O
it	O
so	O
deep	O
a	O
wound	O
as	O
would	O
result	O
from	O
the	O
entire	O
exclusion	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
would	O
best	O
understand	O
its	O
interest	O
from	O
a	O
share	O
in	O
the	O
management	O
of	O
them	.
the	O
importance	O
of	O
commerce	,
in	O
the	O
view	O
of	O
revenue	O
alone	,
must	O
effectually	O
guard	O
it	O
against	O
the	O
enmity	O
of	O
a	O
body	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
continually	O
importuned	O
in	O
its	O

i	O
the	O

upon	O
a	O

between	O
the	O

kinds	O

as	O

understand	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

their	O
elevation	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
necessary	O
consequence	O
of	O

<bos>	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
foregoing	O
review	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	,
i	O
have	O
taken	O
notice	O
of	,
and	O
endeavored	O
to	O
answer	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
objections	O
which	O
have	O
appeared	O
against	O
it	.
there	,

remain	O
a	O
few	O
which	O
either	O
did	O
not	O
fall	O
naturally	O
under	O
any	O
particular	O
head	O
or	O
were	O
forgotten	O
in	O
their	O
proper	O
places	.
these	O
shall	O
now	O
be	O
discussed	;
but	O
as	O
the	O
subject	O
has	O
been	O
drawn	O
into	O
great	O
length	,
i	O
shall	O
so	O
far	O
consult	O
brevity	O
as	O
to	O
comprise	O
all	O
my	O
observations	O
on	O
these	O
miscellaneous	O
points	O
in	O
a	O
single	O
paper	.

<bos>	O
the	O
most	O
considerable	O
of	O
the	O
remaining	O
objections	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	O
contains	O
no	O
bill	O
of	O
rights	.
among	O
other	O
answers	O
given	O
to	O
this	,
it	O
has	O
been	O
upon	O
different	O
occasions	O
remarked	O
that	O
the	O
constitutions	O
of	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
states	O
are	O
in	O
a	O
similar	O
predicament	.
i	O
add	O
that	O
new	O
york	O
is	O
of	O
the	O
number	.
and	O
yet	O
the	O
opposers	O
of	O
the	O
new	O
system	,
in	O
this	O
state	,
who	O
profess	O
an	O
unlimited	O
admiration	O
for	O
its	O
constitution	,
are	O
among	O
the	O
most	O
intemperate	O
partisans	O
of	O
a	O
bill	O
of	O
rights	.
to	O
justify	O
their	O
zeal	O
in	O
this	O
matter	,
they	O
allege	O
two	O
things	:
one	O
is	O
that	,
though	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
new	O
york	O
has	O
no	O
bill	O
of	O
rights	O
prefixed	O
to	O
it	,
yet	O
it	O
contains	,
in	O
the	O
body	O
of	O
it	,
various	O
provisions	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
particular	O
privileges	O
and	O
rights	,
which	,
in	O
substance	O
amount	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
thing	;
the	O
other	O
is	,
that	O
the	O
constitution	O
adopts	,
in	O
their	O
full	O
extent	,
the	O
common	O
and	O
statute	O
law	O
of	O
great	O
britain	,
by	O
which	O
many	O
other	O
rights	,
not	O
expressed	O
in	O
it	,
are	O
equally	O
secured	.

<bos>	O
to	O
the	O
first	O
i	O
answer	,
that	O
the	O
constitution	O
proposed	O
by	O
the	O
convention	O
contains	,
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
this	O
state	,
a	O
number	O
of	O
such	O
provisions	.

to	O
secure	O
the	O
blessings	O
of	O
liberty	O
to	O
ourselves	O
and	O
our	O

do	O
ordain	O
and	O
establish	O
this	O
constitution	O
for	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
of	O
america	.
''	O
here	O
is	O
a	O
better	O
recognition	O
of	O
popular	O
rights	,
than	O
volumes	O
of	O
those	O
aphorisms	O
which	O
make	O
the	O
principal	O
figure	O
in	O
several	O
of	O
our	O
state	O
bills	O
of	O
rights	,
and	O
which	O
would	O
sound	O
much	O
better	O
in	O
a	O
treatise	O
of	O
ethics	O
than	O
in	O
a	O
constitution	O
of	O
government	.

<bos>	O
but	O
a	O
minute	O
detail	O
of	O
particular	O
rights	O
is	O
certainly	O
far	O
less	O
applicable	O
to	O
a	O
constitution	O
like	O
that	O
under	O
consideration	,
which	O
is	O
merely	O
intended	O
to	O
regulate	O
the	O
general	O
political	O
interests	O
of	O
the	O
nation	,
than	O
to	O
a	O
constitution	O
which	O
has	O
the	O
regulation	O
of	O
every	O
species	O
of	O
personal	O
and	O
private	O
concerns	.
if	,
therefore	,
the	O
loud	O
clamors	O
against	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	,
on	O
this	O
score	,
are	O
well	O
founded	,
no	O
epithets	O
of	O
reprobation	O
will	O
be	O
too	O
strong	O
for	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
this	O
state	.
but	O
the	O
truth	O
is	,
that	O
both	O
of	O
them	O
contain	O
all	O
which	,
in	O
relation	O
to	O
their	O
objects	,
is	O
reasonably	O
to	O
be	O
desired	.

<bos>	O
i	O
go	O
further	,
and	O
affirm	O
that	O
bills	O
of	O
rights	,
in	O
the	O
sense	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
extent	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
contended	O
for	,
are	O
not	O
only	O
unnecessary	O
in	O
the	O
proposed	O
constitution	,
but	O
would	O
even	O
be	O
dangerous	.
they	O
would	O
contain	O
various	O
exceptions	O
to	O
powers	O
not	O
granted	;
and	,
on	O
this	O
very	O
account	,
would	O
afford	O
a	O
colorable	O
pretext	O
to	O
claim	O
more	O
than	O
were	O
granted	.
for	O
why	O
declare	O
that	O
things	O
shall	O
not	O
be	O
done	O
which	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
power	O
to	O
do	?
why	,
for	O
instance	,
should	O
it	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
liberty	O
of	O
the	O
press	O
shall	O
not	O
be	O
restrained	,
when	O
no	O
power	O
is	O
given	O
by	O
which	O
restrictions	O
may	O
be	O
imposed	?
i	O
will	O
not	O
contend	O
that	O
such	O
a	O
provision	O
would	O
confer	O
a	O
regulating	O
power	;
but	O
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
furnish	,
to	O
men	O
disposed	O
to	O
usurp	,
a	O
plausible	O
pretense	O
for	O
claiming	O
that	O
power	.
they	O
might	O
urge	O
with	O
a	O
semblance	O
of	O
reason	,
that	O
the	O
constitution	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
charged	O
with	O
the	O
absurdity	O
of	O
providing	O
against	O
the	O
abuse	O
of	O
an	O
authority	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
given	,
and	O
that	O
the	O
provision	O
against	O
restraining	O
the	O
liberty	O
of	O
the	O
press	O
afforded	O
a	O
clear	O
implication	,
that	O
a	O
power	O
to	O
prescribe	O
proper	O
regulations	O
concerning	O
it	O
was	O
intended	O
to	O
be	O
vested	O
in	O
the	O
national	O
government	.
this	O
may	O
serve	O
as	O
a	O
specimen	O
of	O
the	O
numerous	O
handles	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
given	O
to	O
the	O
doctrine	O
of	O
constructive	O
powers	,
by	O
the	O
indulgence	O
of	O
an	O
injudicious	O
zeal	O
for	O
bills	O
of	O
rights	.

<bos>	O
on	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
the	O
liberty	O
of	O
the	O
press	,
as	O
much	O
as	O
has	O
been	O
said	,
i	O
can	O
not	O
forbear	O
adding	O
a	O
remark	O
or	O
two	:
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	,
i	O
observe	,
that	O
there	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
syllable	O
concerning	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
this	O
state	;
in	O
the	O
next	,
i	O
contend	,
that	O
whatever	O
has	O
been	O
said	O
about	O
it	O
in	O
that	O
of	O
any	O
other	O
state	,
amounts	O
to	O
nothing	.
what	O
signifies	O
a	O
declaration	,
that	O
``	O
the	O
liberty	O
of	O
the	O
press	O
shall	O
be	O
inviolably	O
preserved	O
''	?
what	O
is	O
the	O
liberty	O
of	O
the	O
press	?
who	O
can	O
give	O
it	O
any	O
definition	O
which	O
would	O
not	O
leave	O
the	O
utmost	O
latitude	O
for	O
evasion	?
i	O
hold	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
impracticable	;
and	O
from	O
this	O
i	O
infer	,
that	O
its	O
security	,
whatever	O
fine	O
declarations	O
may	O
be	O
inserted	O
in	O
any	O
constitution	O
respecting	O
it	,
must	O
altogether	O
depend	O
on	O
public	O
opinion	,
and	O
on	O
the	O
general	O
spirit	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
government.3	O
and	O
here	,
after	O
all	,
as	O
is	O
intimated	O
upon	O
another	O
occasion	,
must	O
we	O
seek	O
for	O
the	O
only	O
solid	O
basis	O
of	O
all	O
our	O
rights	.

<bos>	O
there	O
remains	O
but	O
one	O
other	O
view	O
of	O
this	O
matter	O
to	O
conclude	O
the	O
point	.
the	O
truth	O
is	,
after	O
all	O
the	O
declamations	O
we	O
have	O
heard	,
that	O
the	O
constitution	O
is	O
itself	,
in	O
every	O
rational	O
sense	,
and	O
to	O
every	O
useful	O
purpose	,
a	O
bill	O
of	O
rights	.
the	O
several	O
bills	O
of	O
rights	O
in	O
great	O
britain	O
form	O
its	O
constitution	,
and	O
conversely	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
each	O
state	O
is	O
its	O
bill	O
of	O
rights	.
and	O
the	O
proposed	O
constitution	,
if	O
adopted	,
will	O
be	O
the	O
bill	O
of	O
rights	O
of	O
the	O
union	.
is	O
it	O
one	O
object	O
of	O
a	O
bill	O
of	O
rights	O
to	O
declare	O
and	O
specify	O
the	O
political	O
privileges	O
of	O
the	O
citizens	O
in	O
the	O
structure	O
and	O
administration	O
of	O
the	O
government	?
this	O
is	O
done	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
ample	O
and	O
precise	O
manner	O
in	O
the	O
plan	O
of	O
the	O
convention	;
comprehending	O
various	O
precautions	O
for	O
the	O
public	O
security	,
which	O
are	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
constitutions	.
is	O
another	O
object	O
of	O
a	O
bill	O
of	O
rights	O
to	O
define	O
certain	O
immunities	O
and	O
modes	O
of	O
proceeding	,
which	O
are	O
relative	O
to	O
personal	O
and	O
private	O
concerns	?
this	O
we	O
have	O
seen	O
has	O
also	O
been	O
attended	O
to	,
in	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
cases	,
in	O
the	O
same	O
plan	.
adverting	O
therefore	O
to	O
the	O
substantial	O
meaning	O
of	O
a	O
bill	O
of	O
rights	,
it	O
is	O
absurd	O
to	O
allege	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
work	O
of	O
the	O
convention	.
it	O
may	O
be	O
said	O
that	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
go	O
far	O
enough	,
though	O
it	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
easy	O
to	O
make	O
this	O
appear	;
but	O
it	O
can	O
with	O
no	O
propriety	O
be	O
contended	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
such	O
thing	.
it	O
certainly	O
must	O
be	O
immaterial	O
what	O
mode	O
is	O
observed	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
order	O
of	O
declaring	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
the	O
citizens	,
if	O
they	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
any	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
instrument	O
which	O
establishes	O
the	O
government	.
and	O
hence	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
apparent	,
that	O
much	O
of	O
what	O
has	O
been	O
said	O
on	O
this	O
subject	O
rests	O
merely	O
on	O
verbal	O
and	O
nominal	O
distinctions	,
entirely	O
foreign	O
from	O
the	O
substance	O
of	O
the	O
thing	.

<bos>	O
another	O
objection	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
made	,
and	O
which	,
from	O
the	O
frequency	O
of	O
its	O
repetition	,
it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
presumed	O
is	O
relied	O
on	,

of	O
this	O
nature	:

to	O

upon	O

the	O

must	O
of	O
necessity	O
be	O

remote	O

''	O
this	O
argument	,
if	O
it	O
proves	O
any	O
thing	,
proves	O
that	O
there	O
ought	O
to	O

no	O
general	O

whatever	.
for	O
the	O
powers	O
which	,
it	O

to	O

agreed	O
on	O

there	O
are	O
satisfactory	O
reasons	O
to	O
show	O
that	O
the	O

there	O
is	O
in	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
arguments	O
which	O
relate	O
to	O
distance	O
a	O
palpable	O
illusion	O
of	O
the	O
imagination	.
what	O
are	O
the	O
sources	O
of	O
information	O
by	O
which	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
montgomery	O

regulate	O
their	O
judgment	O
of	O
the	O
conduct	O
of	O

in	O
the	O
state	O

no	O
benefit	.
this	O

confined	O
to	O
the	O

must	O
therefore	O
depend	O
on	O
the	O
information	O
of	O

whom	O
they	O
confide	;

to	O
all	O

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O

may	O
conclude	O
with	O
the	O

assurance	O

article	O
of	O
expense	.
if	O
it	O
were	O
even	O
true	,
that	O
the	O
adoption	O
of	O
the	O
proposed	O
government	O
would	O
occasion	O
a	O
considerable	O
increase	O
of	O
expense	,
it	O
would	O
be	O
an	O
objection	O
that	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
no	O
weight	O
against	O
the	O
plan	.

<bos>	O
the	O
great	O
bulk	O
of	O
the	O
citizens	O
of	O
america	O
are	O
with	O
reason	O
convinced	,
that	O
union	O
is	O
the	O
basis	O
of	O

political	O
happiness	.
men	O
of	O
sense	O
of	O
all	O
parties	O
now	,
with	O
few	O
exceptions	,
agree	O
that	O
it	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
preserved	O
under	O
the	O
present	O
system	,
nor	O
without	O
radical	O
alterations	;
that	O
new	O
and	O
extensive	O
powers	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
granted	O
to	O
the	O
national	O
head	,
and	O
that	O
these	O
require	O
a	O
different	O
organization	O
of	O
the	O
federal	O
government	O
a	O
single	O
body	O
being	O
an	O
unsafe	O
depositary	O
of	O
such	O
ample	O
authorities	.
in	O
conceding	O
all	O
this	,
the	O
question	O
of	O
expense	O
must	O
be	O
given	O
up	;
for	O
it	O
is	O
impossible	,
with	O
any	O
degree	O
of	O
safety	,
to	O
narrow	O
the	O
foundation	O
upon	O
which	O
the	O
system	O
is	O
to	O
stand	.
the	O
two	O
branches	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	O
are	,
in	O
the	O
first	O
instance	,
to	O
consist	O
of	O
only	O
sixty-five	O
persons	,
which	O
is	O
the	O
same	O
number	O
of	O
which	O
congress	,
under	O
the	O
existing	O
confederation	,
may	O
be	O
composed	.
it	O
is	O
true	O
that	O
this	O
number	O
is	O
intended	O
to	O
be	O
increased	;
but	O
this	O
is	O
to	O
keep	O
pace	O
with	O
the	O
progress	O
of	O
the	O
population	O
and	O
resources	O
of	O
the	O
country	.
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
a	O
less	O
number	O
would	,
even	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
instance	,
have	O
been	O
unsafe	,
and	O
that	O
a	O
continuance	O
of	O
the	O
present	O
number	O
would	,
in	O
a	O
more	O
advanced	O
stage	O
of	O
population	,
be	O
a	O
very	O
inadequate	O
representation	O
of	O
the	O
people	.

<bos>	O
whence	O
is	O
the	O
dreaded	O
augmentation	O
of	O
expense	O
to	O
spring	?
one	O
source	O
indicated	,
is	O
the	O
multiplication	O
of	O
offices	O
under	O
the	O
new	O
government	.
let	O
us	O
examine	O
this	O
a	O
little	.

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
the	O
principal	O
departments	O
of	O
the	O
administration	O
under	O
the	O
present	O
government	,
are	O
the	O
same	O
which	O
will	O
be	O
required	O
under	O
the	O
new	.
there	O
are	O
now	O
a	O
secretary	O
of	O
war	,
a	O
secretary	O
of	O
foreign	O
affairs	,
a	O
secretary	O
for	O
domestic	O
affairs	,
a	O
board	O
of	O
treasury	,
consisting	O
of	O
three	O
persons	,
a	O
treasurer	,
assistants	,
clerks	,
etc	.
these	O
officers	O
are	O
indispensable	O
under	O
any	O
system	,
and	O
will	O
suffice	O
under	O
the	O
new	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
old	.
as	O
to	O
ambassadors	O
and	O
other	O
ministers	O
and	O
agents	O
in	O
foreign	O
countries	,
the	O
proposed	O
constitution	O
can	O
make	O
no	O
other	O
difference	O
than	O
to	O
render	O
their	O
characters	,
where	O
they	O
reside	,
more	O
respectable	,
and	O
their	O
services	O
more	O
useful	.
as	O
to	O
persons	O
to	O
be	O
employed	O
in	O
the	O
collection	O
of	O
the	O
revenues	,
it	O
is	O
unquestionably	O
true	O
that	O
these	O
will	O
form	O
a	O
very	O
considerable	O
addition	O
to	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
federal	O
officers	;
but	O
it	O
will	O
not	O
follow	O
that	O
this	O
will	O
occasion	O
an	O
increase	O
of	O
public	O
expense	.
it	O
will	O
be	O
in	O
most	O
cases	O
nothing	O
more	O
than	O
an	O
exchange	O
of	O
state	O
for	O
national	O
officers	.
in	O
the	O
collection	O
of	O
all	O
duties	,
for	O
instance	,
the	O
persons	O
employed	O
will	O
be	O
wholly	O
of	O
the	O
latter	O
description	.
the	O
states	O
individually	O
will	O
stand	O
in	O
no	O
need	O
of	O
any	O
for	O
this	O
purpose	.
what	O
difference	O
can	O
it	O
make	O
in	O
point	O
of	O
expense	O
to	O
pay	O
officers	O
of	O
the	O
customs	O
appointed	O
by	O
the	O
state	O
or	O
by	O
the	O
united	O
states	?
there	O
is	O
no	O
good	O
reason	O
to	O
suppose	O
that	O
either	O
the	O
number	O
or	O
the	O
salaries	O
of	O
the	O
latter	O
will	O
be	O
greater	O
than	O
those	O
of	O
the	O
former	.

<bos>	O
where	O
then	O
are	O
we	O
to	O
seek	O
for	O
those	O
additional	O
articles	O
of	O
expense	O
which	O
are	O
to	O
swell	O
the	O
account	O
to	O
the	O
enormous	O
size	O
that	O
has	O
been	O
represented	O
to	O
us	?
the	O
chief	O
item	O
which	O
occurs	O
to	O
me	O
respects	O
the	O
support	O
of	O
the	O
judges	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	.
i	O
do	O
not	O
add	O
the	O
president	,
because	O
there	O
is	O
now	O
a	O
president	O
of	O
congress	,
whose	O
expenses	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
far	,
if	O
any	O
thing	,
short	O
of	O
those	O
which	O
will	O
be	O
incurred	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
president	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	.
the	O
support	O
of	O
the	O
judges	O
will	O
clearly	O
be	O
an	O
extra	O
expense	,
but	O
to	O
what	O
extent	O
will	O
depend	O
on	O
the	O
particular	O
plan	O
which	O
may	O
be	O
adopted	O
in	O
regard	O
to	O
this	O
matter	.
but	O
upon	O
no	O
reasonable	O
plan	O
can	O
it	O
amount	O
to	O
a	O
sum	O
which	O
will	O
be	O
an	O
object	O
of	O
material	O
consequence	.

<bos>	O
let	O
us	O
now	O
see	O
what	O
there	O
is	O
to	O
counterbalance	O
any	O
extra	O
expense	O
that	O
may	O
attend	O
the	O
establishment	O
of	O
the	O
proposed	O
government	.
the	O
first	O
thing	O
which	O
presents	O
itself	O
is	O
that	O
a	O
great	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
business	O
which	O
now	O
keeps	O
congress	O
sitting	O
through	O
the	O
year	O
will	O
be	O
transacted	O
by	O
the	O
president	.
even	O
the	O
management	O
of	O
foreign	O
negotiations	O
will	O
naturally	O
devolve	O
upon	O
him	,
according	O
to	O
general	O
principles	O
concerted	O
with	O
the	O
senate	,
and	O
subject	O
to	O
their	O
final	O
concurrence	.
hence	O
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
a	O
portion	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
will	O
suffice	O
for	O
the	O
session	O
of	O
both	O
the	O
senate	O
and	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	;
we	O
may	O
suppose	O
about	O
a	O
fourth	O
for	O
the	O
latter	O
and	O
a	O
third	,
or	O
perhaps	O
half	,
for	O
the	O
former	.
the	O
extra	O
business	O
of	O
treaties	O
and	O
appointments	O
may	O
give	O
this	O
extra	O
occupation	O
to	O
the	O
senate	.
from	O
this	O
circumstance	O
we	O
may	O
infer	O
that	,
until	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	O
shall	O
be	O
increased	O
greatly	O
beyond	O
its	O
present	O
number	,
there	O
will	O
be	O
a	O
considerable	O
saving	O
of	O
expense	O
from	O
the	O
difference	O
between	O
the	O
constant	O
session	O
of	O
the	O
present	O
and	O
the	O
temporary	O
session	O
of	O
the	O
future	O
congress	.

<bos>	O
but	O
there	O
is	O
another	O
circumstance	O
of	O
great	O
importance	O
in	O
the	O
view	O
of	O
economy	.
the	O
business	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
has	O
hitherto	O
occupied	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	,
as	O
well	O
as	O
congress	.
the	O
latter	O
has	O
made	O
requisitions	O
which	O
the	O
former	O
have	O
had	O
to	O
provide	O
for	.
hence	O
it	O
has	O
happened	O
that	O
the	O
sessions	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	O
have	O
been	O
protracted	O
greatly	O
beyond	O
what	O
was	O
necessary	O
for	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
the	O
mere	O
local	O
business	O
of	O
the	O
states	.
more	O
than	O
half	O
their	O
time	O
has	O
been	O
frequently	O
employed	O
in	O
matters	O
which	O
related	O
to	O
the	O
united	O
states	.
now	O
the	O
members	O
who	O
compose	O
the	O
legislatures	O
of	O
the	O
several	O
states	O
amount	O
to	O
two	O
thousand	O
and	O
upwards	,
which	O
number	O
has	O
hitherto	O
performed	O
what	O
under	O
the	O
new	O
system	O
will	O
be	O
done	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
instance	O
by	O
sixty-five	O
persons	,
and	O
probably	O
at	O
no	O
future	O
period	O
by	O
above	O
a	O
fourth	O
or	O
fifth	O
of	O
that	O
number	.
the	O
congress	O
under	O
the	O
proposed	O
government	O
will	O
do	O
all	O
the	O
business	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
themselves	,
without	O
the	O
intervention	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	,
who	O
thenceforth	O
will	O
have	O
only	O
to	O
attend	O
to	O
the	O
affairs	O
of	O
their	O
particular	O
states	,
and	O
will	O
not	O
have	O
to	O
sit	O
in	O
any	O
proportion	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
they	O
have	O
heretofore	O
done	.
this	O
difference	O
in	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
sessions	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	O
will	O
be	O
clear	O
gain	,
and	O
will	O
alone	O
form	O
an	O
article	O
of	O
saving	,
which	O
may	O
be	O
regarded	O
as	O
an	O
equivalent	O
for	O
any	O
additional	O
objects	O
of	O
expense	O
that	O
may	O
be	O
occasioned	O
by	O
the	O
adoption	O
of	O
the	O
new	O
system	.

<bos>	O
the	O
result	O
from	O
these	O
observations	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
sources	O
of	O
additional	O
expense	O
from	O
the	O
establishment	O
of	O
the	O
proposed	O
constitution	O
are	O
much	O
fewer	O
than	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
imagined	;
that	O
they	O
are	O
counterbalanced	O
by	O
considerable	O
objects	O
of	O
saving	;
and	O
that	O
while	O
it	O
is	O
questionable	O
on	O
which	O
side	O
the	O
scale	O
will	O
preponderate	,
it	O
is	O
certain	O
that	O
a	O
government	O
less	O
expensive	O
would	O
be	O
incompetent	O
to	O
the	O
purposes	O
of	O
the	O
union	.
