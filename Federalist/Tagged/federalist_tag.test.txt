the	O

the	O

it	O
seems	O
strictly	O
consonant	O

to	O

there	O
is	O
certainly	O
great	O
force	O
in	O
this	O
reasoning	,
and	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
allowed	O
to	O
prove	O
that	O
a	O
constitutional	O
road	O
to	O
the	O
decision	O
of	O
the	O

ought	O
to	O
be	O
marked	O
out	O
and	O
kept	O
open	,
for	O
certain	O
great	O
and	O
extraordinary	O
occasions	.
but	O
there	O
appear	O
to	O
be	O
insuperable	O
objections	O
against	O
the	O
proposed	O
recurrence	O
to	O
the	O
people	,
as	O
a	O
provision	O
in	O
all	O
cases	O
for	O
keeping	O
the	O
several	O

of	O
power	O
within	O
their	O
constitutional	O
limits	.
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	,
the	O
provision	O
does	O
not	O
reach	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
a	O
combination	O
of	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
departments	O
against	O
the	O
third	.
if	O
the	O
legislative	O
authority	,
which	O
possesses	O
so	O
many	O
means	O
of	O
operating	O
on	O
the	O
motives	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
departments	,
should	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
gain	O
to	O
its	O
interest	O
either	O
of	O
the	O
others	,
or	O
even	O
one	O
third	O
of	O
its	O

the	O

could	O
derive	O
no	O
advantage	O
from	O
its	O
remedial	O
provision	.
i	O
do	O
not	O
dwell	,
however	,
on	O
this	O
objection	,
because	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
thought	O
to	O
be	O
rather	O
against	O
the	O
modification	O
of	O
the	O
principle	,
than	O
against	O
the	O
principle	O
itself	.
in	O
the	O
next	O
place	,
it	O
may	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
an	O
objection	O
inherent	O
in	O
the	O
principle	,
that	O
as	O
every	O
appeal	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
would	O
carry	O
an	O
implication	O
of	O
some	O
defect	O
in	O
the	O
government	,
frequent	O
appeals	O
would	,
in	O
a	O
great	O
measure	,
deprive	O
the	O
government	O
of	O
that	O
veneration	O
which	O
time	O
bestows	O
on	O
every	O
thing	,
and	O
without	O
which	O
perhaps	O
the	O
wisest	O
and	O
freest	O
governments	O
would	O
not	O
possess	O
the	O
requisite	O
stability	.

<bos>	O
if	O
it	O
be	O
true	O
that	O
all	O
governments	O
rest	O
on	O
opinion	,
it	O
is	O
no	O
less	O
true	O
that	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
opinion	O
in	O
each	O
individual	,
and	O
its	O
practical	O
influence	O
on	O
his	O
conduct	,
depend	O
much	O
on	O
the	O
number	O
which	O
he	O
supposes	O
to	O
have	O
entertained	O
the	O
same	O
opinion	.
the	O
reason	O
of	O
man	,
like	O
man	O
himself	,
is	O
timid	O
and	O
cautious	O
when	O
left	O
alone	,
and	O
acquires	O
firmness	O
and	O
confidence	O
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
the	O
number	O
with	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
associated	.
when	O
the	O
examples	O
which	O
fortify	O
opinion	O
are	O
ancient	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
numerous	,
they	O
are	O
known	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
double	O
effect	.
in	O
a	O
nation	O
of	O
philosophers	,
this	O
consideration	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
disregarded	.
a	O
reverence	O
for	O
the	O
laws	O
would	O
be	O
sufficiently	O
inculcated	O
by	O
the	O
voice	O
of	O
an	O
enlightened	O
reason	.
but	O
a	O
nation	O
of	O
philosophers	O
is	O
as	O
little	O
to	O
be	O
expected	O
as	O
the	O
philosophical	O
race	O
of	O
kings	O
wished	O
for	O
by	O
plato	.
and	O
in	O
every	O
other	O
nation	,
the	O
most	O
rational	O
government	O
will	O
not	O
find	O
it	O
a	O
superfluous	O
advantage	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
prejudices	O
of	O
the	O
community	O
on	O
its	O
side	.
the	O
danger	O
of	O
disturbing	O
the	O
public	O
tranquillity	O
by	O
interesting	O
too	O
strongly	O
the	O
public	O
passions	,
is	O
a	O
still	O
more	O
serious	O
objection	O
against	O
a	O
frequent	O
reference	O
of	O
constitutional	O
questions	O
to	O
the	O
decision	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
society	.
notwithstanding	O
the	O
success	O
which	O
has	O
attended	O
the	O
revisions	O
of	O
our	O
established	O
forms	O
of	O
government	,
and	O
which	O
does	O
so	O
much	O
honor	O
to	O
the	O
virtue	O
and	O
intelligence	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
america	,
it	O
must	O
be	O
confessed	O
that	O
the	O
experiments	O
are	O
of	O
too	O
ticklish	O
a	O
nature	O
to	O
be	O
unnecessarily	O
multiplied	.

<bos>	O
we	O
are	O
to	O
recollect	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
existing	O
constitutions	O
were	O
formed	O
in	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
a	O
danger	O
which	O
repressed	O
the	O
passions	O
most	O
unfriendly	O
to	O
order	O
and	O
concord	;
of	O
an	O
enthusiastic	O
confidence	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
their	O
patriotic	O
leaders	,
which	O
stifled	O
the	O
ordinary	O
diversity	O
of	O
opinions	O
on	O
great	O
national	O
questions	;
of	O
a	O
universal	O
ardor	O
for	O
new	O
and	O
opposite	O
forms	,
produced	O
by	O
a	O
universal	O
resentment	O
and	O
indignation	O
against	O
the	O
ancient	O
government	;
and	O
whilst	O
no	O
spirit	O
of	O
party	O
connected	O
with	O
the	O
changes	O
to	O
be	O
made	,
or	O
the	O
abuses	O
to	O
be	O
reformed	,
could	O
mingle	O
its	O
leaven	O
in	O
the	O
operation	.
the	O
future	O
situations	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
must	O
expect	O
to	O
be	O
usually	O
placed	,
do	O
not	O
present	O
any	O
equivalent	O
security	O
against	O
the	O
danger	O
which	O
is	O
apprehended	.
but	O
the	O
greatest	O
objection	O
of	O
all	O
is	,
that	O
the	O
decisions	O
which	O
would	O
probably	O
result	O
from	O
such	O
appeals	O
would	O
not	O
answer	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
maintaining	O
the	O
constitutional	O
equilibrium	O
of	O
the	O
government	.

<bos>	O
we	O
have	O
seen	O
that	O
the	O
tendency	O
of	O
republican	O
governments	O
is	O
to	O
an	O
aggrandizement	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
at	O
the	O
expense	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
departments	.
the	O
appeals	O
to	O
the	O
people	,
therefore	,
would	O
usually	O
be	O
made	O
by	O
the	O
executive	O
and	O
judiciary	O
departments	.
but	O
whether	O
made	O
by	O
one	O
side	O
or	O
the	O
other	,
would	O
each	O
side	O
enjoy	O
equal	O
advantages	O
on	O
the	O
trial	?
let	O
us	O
view	O
their	O
different	O
situations	.
the	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
executive	O
and	O
judiciary	O
departments	O
are	O
few	O
in	O
number	,
and	O
can	O
be	O
personally	O
known	O
to	O
a	O
small	O
part	O
only	O
of	O
the	O
people	.
the	O
latter	,
by	O
the	O
mode	O
of	O
their	O
appointment	,
as	O
well	O
as	O
by	O
the	O
nature	O
and	O
permanency	O
of	O
it	,
are	O
too	O
far	O
removed	O
from	O
the	O
people	O
to	O
share	O
much	O
in	O
their	O
prepossessions	.
the	O
former	O
are	O
generally	O
the	O
objects	O
of	O
jealousy	,
and	O
their	O
administration	O
is	O
always	O
liable	O
to	O
be	O
discolored	O
and	O
rendered	O
unpopular	.
the	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
department	,
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	,
are	O
numberous	.
they	O
are	O
distributed	O
and	O
dwell	O
among	O
the	O
people	O
at	O
large	.
their	O
connections	O
of	O
blood	,
of	O
friendship	,
and	O
of	O
acquaintance	O
embrace	O
a	O
great	O
proportion	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
influential	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
society	.
the	O
nature	O
of	O
their	O
public	O
trust	O
implies	O
a	O
personal	O
influence	O
among	O
the	O
people	,
and	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
more	O
immediately	O
the	O
confidential	O
guardians	O
of	O
the	O
rights	O
and	O
liberties	O
of	O
the	O
people	.

<bos>	O
with	O
these	O
advantages	,
it	O
can	O
hardly	O
be	O
supposed	O
that	O
the	O
adverse	O
party	O
would	O
have	O
an	O
equal	O
chance	O
for	O
a	O
favorable	O
issue	.
but	O
the	O
legislative	O
party	O
would	O
not	O
only	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
plead	O
their	O
cause	O
most	O
successfully	O
with	O
the	O
people	.
they	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
constituted	O
themselves	O
the	O
judges	.
the	O
same	O
influence	O
which	O
had	O
gained	O
them	O
an	O
election	O
into	O
the	O
legislature	,
would	O
gain	O
them	O
a	O
seat	O
in	O
the	O
convention	.
if	O
this	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
the	O
case	O
with	O
all	,
it	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
the	O
case	O
with	O
many	,
and	O
pretty	O
certainly	O
with	O
those	O
leading	O
characters	,
on	O
whom	O
every	O
thing	O
depends	O
in	O
such	O
bodies	.
the	O
convention	,
in	O
short	,
would	O
be	O
composed	O
chiefly	O
of	O
men	O
who	O
had	O
been	,
who	O
actually	O
were	,
or	O
who	O
expected	O
to	O
be	,
members	O
of	O
the	O
department	O
whose	O
conduct	O
was	O
arraigned	.
they	O
would	O
consequently	O
be	O
parties	O
to	O
the	O
very	O
question	O
to	O
be	O
decided	O
by	O
them	.
it	O
might	,
however	,
sometimes	O
happen	,
that	O
appeals	O
would	O
be	O
made	O
under	O
circumstances	O
less	O
adverse	O
to	O
the	O
executive	O
and	O
judiciary	O
departments	.
the	O
usurpations	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	O
might	O
be	O
so	O
flagrant	O
and	O
so	O
sudden	,
as	O
to	O
admit	O
of	O
no	O
specious	O
coloring	.
a	O
strong	O
party	O
among	O
themselves	O
might	O
take	O
side	O
with	O
the	O
other	O
branches	.
the	O
executive	O
power	O
might	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
a	O
peculiar	O
favorite	O
of	O
the	O
people	.

<bos>	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
posture	O
of	O
things	,
the	O
public	O
decision	O
might	O
be	O
less	O
swayed	O
by	O
prepossessions	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
party	.
but	O
still	O
it	O
could	O
never	O
be	O
expected	O
to	O
turn	O
on	O
the	O
true	O
merits	O
of	O
the	O
question	.
it	O
would	O
inevitably	O
be	O
connected	O
with	O
the	O
spirit	O
of	O
pre-existing	O
parties	,
or	O
of	O
parties	O
springing	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
question	O
itself	.
it	O
would	O
be	O
connected	O
with	O
persons	O
of	O
distinguished	O
character	O
and	O
extensive	O
influence	O
in	O
the	O
community	.
it	O
would	O
be	O
pronounced	O
by	O
the	O
very	O
men	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
agents	O
in	,
or	O
opponents	O
of	,
the	O
measures	O
to	O
which	O
the	O
decision	O
would	O
relate	.
the	O
passions	,
therefore	,
not	O
the	O
reason	,
of	O
the	O
public	O
would	O
sit	O
in	O
judgment	.
but	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
reason	,
alone	,
of	O
the	O
public	,
that	O
ought	O
to	O
control	O
and	O
regulate	O
the	O
government	.
the	O
passions	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
controlled	O
and	O
regulated	O
by	O
the	O
government	.
we	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
paper	,
that	O
mere	O
declarations	O
in	O
the	O
written	O
constitution	O
are	O
not	O
sufficient	O
to	O
restrain	O
the	O
several	O
departments	O
within	O
their	O
legal	O
rights	.
it	O
appears	O
in	O
this	,
that	O
occasional	O
appeals	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
would	O
be	O
neither	O
a	O
proper	O
nor	O
an	O
effectual	O
provision	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	.
how	O
far	O
the	O
provisions	O

that	O

which	O
are	O

to	O
the	O

of	O

it	O
will	O
be	O

that	O
in	O

examination	O
of	O
these	O

i	O
confine	O
myself	O
to	O
their	O
aptitude	O
for	O
enforcing	O
the	O

by	O
keeping	O
the	O

due	O
bounds	,

itself	.
in	O
the	O
first	O
view	,
appeals	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
at	O
fixed	O
periods	O
appear	O
to	O
be	O
nearly	O
as	O
ineligible	O
as	O

occasions	O
as	O
they	O
emerge	.
if	O
the	O

be	O
separated	O
by	O

the	O

be	O
connected	O
with	O
all	O
the	O

which	O
tend	O
to	O
vitiate	O
and	O

the	O
result	O
of	O
occasional	O
revisions	.
if	O
the	O
periods	O
be	O
distant	O
from	O
each	O

the	O

remark	O
will	O
be	O
applicable	O
to	O
all	O
recent	O
measures	;
and	O
in	O
proportion	O
as	O
the	O
remoteness	O
of	O
the	O

may	O
favor	O
a	O
dispassionate	O
review	O
of	O

this	O

it	.
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	,

breaking	O
through	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

would	O
be	O

in	O

of	O

was	,
as	O
we	O
have	O
seen	,
to	O

``	O
whether	O

points	O
of	O

very	O
particular	O
attention	.
in	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
it	O
may	,
perhaps	,
as	O
a	O
single	O
experiment	,
made	O
under	O
circumstances	O
somewhat	O
peculiar	,
be	O
thought	O
to	O

not	O
absolutely	O
conclusive	.

as	O

to	O

it	O

some	O
facts	,
which	O

venture	O
to	O

a	O
complete	O
and	O

illustration	O

first	.
it	O
appears	,
from	O
the	O
names	O
of	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
who	O
composed	O
the	O
council	,
that	O
some	,
at	O
least	,
of	O
its	O
most	O
active	O
members	O
had	O
also	O
been	O
active	O
and	O
leading	O
characters	O
in	O
the	O
parties	O
which	O
pre-existed	O
in	O

<bos>	O
secondly	.
it	O
appears	O
that	O
the	O
same	O
active	O
and	O
leading	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
council	O
had	O
been	O
active	O
and	O

of	O

members	O
of	O
the	O

within	O
the	O
seven	O

every	O

the	O
effect	O
of	O

circumstances	O

the	O
temper	O
of	O
their	O
deliberations	.
throughout	O
the	O
continuance	O
of	O
the	O
council	,
it	O
was	O
split	O
into	O
two	O
fixed	O
and	O
violent	O
parties	.
the	O
fact	O
is	O
acknowledged	O
and	O
lamented	O
by	O
themselves	.
had	O
this	O
not	O
been	O
the	O
case	,
the	O
face	O
of	O
their	O
proceedings	O
exhibits	O
a	O
proof	O
equally	O
satisfactory	.
in	O
all	O
questions	,
however	O
unimportant	O
in	O
themselves	,
or	O
unconnected	O
with	O
each	O
other	,
the	O
same	O
names	O
stand	O
invariably	O
contrasted	O
on	O
the	O
opposite	O
columns	.
every	O
unbiased	O
observer	O
may	O
infer	,
without	O
danger	O
of	O
mistake	,
and	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
without	O
meaning	O
to	O
reflect	O
on	O
either	O
party	,
or	O
any	O
individuals	O
of	O
either	O
party	,
that	,
unfortunately	,
passion	,
not	O
reason	,
must	O
have	O
presided	O
over	O
their	O
decisions	.
when	O
men	O
exercise	O
their	O
reason	O
coolly	O
and	O
freely	O
on	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
distinct	O
questions	,
they	O
inevitably	O
fall	O
into	O
different	O
opinions	O
on	O
some	O
of	O
them	.
when	O
they	O
are	O
governed	O
by	O
a	O
common	O
passion	,
their	O
opinions	,
if	O
they	O
are	O
so	O
to	O
be	O
called	,
will	O
be	O
the	O
same	.

<bos>	O
fourthly	.
it	O
is	O
at	O
least	O
problematical	,
whether	O
the	O
decisions	O
of	O
this	O
body	O
do	O
not	,
in	O
several	O
instances	,
misconstrue	O
the	O
limits	O
prescribed	O
for	O
the	O
legislative	O
and	O
executive	O
departments	,
instead	O
of	O
reducing	O
and	O
limiting	O
them	O
within	O
their	O
constitutional	O
places	.

<bos>	O
fifthly	.
i	O
have	O
never	O
understood	O
that	O
the	O
decisions	O
of	O
the	O
council	O
on	O
constitutional	O
questions	,
whether	O
rightly	O
or	O
erroneously	O
formed	,
have	O
had	O
any	O
effect	O
in	O
varying	O
the	O
practice	O
founded	O
on	O
legislative	O
constructions	.
it	O
even	O
appears	,
if	O
i	O
mistake	O
not	,
that	O
in	O
one	O
instance	O
the	O
contemporary	O
legislature	O
denied	O
the	O
constructions	O
of	O
the	O
council	,
and	O
actually	O
prevailed	O
in	O
the	O
contest	.
this	O
censorial	O
body	,
therefore	,
proves	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	,
by	O
its	O
researches	,
the	O
existence	O
of	O
the	O
disease	,
and	O
by	O
its	O
example	,
the	O
inefficacy	O
of	O
the	O
remedy	.
this	O
conclusion	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
invalidated	O
by	O
alleging	O
that	O
the	O
state	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
experiment	O
was	O
made	O
was	O
at	O
that	O
crisis	,
and	O
had	O
been	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
before	,
violently	O
heated	O
and	O
distracted	O
by	O
the	O
rage	O
of	O
party	.

<bos>	O
is	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
presumed	,
that	O
at	O
any	O
future	O
septennial	O
epoch	O
the	O
same	O
state	O
will	O
be	O
free	O
from	O
parties	?
is	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
presumed	O
that	O
any	O
other	O
state	,
at	O
the	O
same	O
or	O
any	O
other	O
given	O
period	,
will	O
be	O
exempt	O
from	O
them	?
such	O
an	O
event	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
neither	O
presumed	O
nor	O
desired	;
because	O
an	O
extinction	O
of	O
parties	O
necessarily	O
implies	O
either	O
a	O
universal	O
alarm	O
for	O
the	O
public	O
safety	,
or	O
an	O
absolute	O
extinction	O
of	O
liberty	.
were	O
the	O
precaution	O
taken	O
of	O
excluding	O
from	O
the	O
assemblies	O
elected	O
by	O
the	O
people	,
to	O
revise	O
the	O
preceding	O
administration	O
of	O
the	O
government	,
all	O
persons	O
who	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
concerned	O
with	O
the	O
government	O
within	O
the	O
given	O
period	,
the	O
difficulties	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
obviated	.
the	O
important	O
task	O
would	O
probably	O
devolve	O
on	O
men	,
who	,
with	O
inferior	O
capacities	,
would	O
in	O
other	O
respects	O
be	O
little	O
better	O
qualified	.
although	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
personally	O
concerned	O
in	O
the	O
administration	,
and	O
therefore	O
not	O
immediately	O
agents	O
in	O
the	O
measures	O
to	O
be	O
examined	,
they	O
would	O
probably	O
have	O
been	O
involved	O
in	O
the	O
parties	O
connected	O
with	O
these	O
measures	,
and	O
have	O
been	O
elected	O
under	O
their	O
auspices	.

<bos>	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
new	O
york	:

<bos>	O
to	O
what	O
expedient	,
then	,
shall	O
we	O
finally	O
resort	,
for	O
maintaining	O
in	O
practice	O
the	O
necessary	O
partition	O
of	O
power	O
among	O
the	O
several	O
departments	,
as	O
laid	O
down	O
in	O
the	O
constitution	?
the	O
only	O
answer	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
given	O
is	,
that	O
as	O
all	O
these	O
exterior	O
provisions	O
are	O
found	O
to	O
be	O
inadequate	,
the	O
defect	O
must	O
be	O
supplied	,
by	O
so	O
contriving	O
the	O
interior	O
structure	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
as	O
that	O
its	O
several	O
constituent	O
parts	O
may	,
by	O
their	O
mutual	O
relations	,
be	O
the	O
means	O
of	O
keeping	O
each	O
other	O
in	O
their	O
proper	O
places	.
without	O
presuming	O
to	O
undertake	O
a	O
full	O
development	O
of	O
this	O
important	O
idea	,
i	O
will	O
hazard	O
a	O
few	O
general	O
observations	,
which	O
may	O
perhaps	O
place	O
it	O
in	O
a	O
clearer	O
light	,
and	O
enable	O
us	O
to	O
form	O
a	O
more	O
correct	O
judgment	O
of	O
the	O
principles	O
and	O
structure	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
planned	O
by	O
the	O
convention	.

<bos>	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
lay	O
a	O
due	O
foundation	O
for	O
that	O
separate	O
and	O
distinct	O
exercise	O
of	O
the	O
different	O
powers	O
of	O
government	,
which	O
to	O
a	O
certain	O
extent	O
is	O
admitted	O
on	O
all	O
hands	O
to	O
be	O
essential	O
to	O
the	O
preservation	O
of	O
liberty	,
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
each	O
department	O
should	O
have	O
a	O
will	O
of	O
its	O
own	;
and	O
consequently	O
should	O
be	O
so	O
constituted	O
that	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
each	O
should	O
have	O
as	O
little	O
agency	O
as	O
possible	O
in	O
the	O
appointment	O
of	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
others	.
were	O
this	O
principle	O
rigorously	O
adhered	O
to	,
it	O
would	O
require	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
appointments	O
for	O
the	O
supreme	O
executive	,
legislative	,
and	O
judiciary	O
magistracies	O
should	O
be	O
drawn	O
from	O
the	O
same	O
fountain	O
of	O
authority	,
the	O
people	,
through	O
channels	O
having	O
no	O
communication	O
whatever	O
with	O
one	O
another	.
perhaps	O
such	O
a	O
plan	O
of	O
constructing	O
the	O
several	O
departments	O
would	O
be	O
less	O
difficult	O
in	O
practice	O
than	O
it	O
may	O
in	O
contemplation	O
appear	.
some	O
difficulties	,
however	,
and	O
some	O
additional	O
expense	O
would	O
attend	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
it	.
some	O
deviations	,
therefore	,
from	O
the	O
principle	O
must	O
be	O
admitted	.
in	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
the	O
judiciary	O
department	O
in	O
particular	,
it	O
might	O
be	O
inexpedient	O
to	O
insist	O
rigorously	O
on	O
the	O
principle	:
first	,
because	O
peculiar	O
qualifications	O
being	O
essential	O
in	O
the	O
members	,
the	O
primary	O
consideration	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
to	O
select	O
that	O
mode	O
of	O
choice	O
which	O
best	O
secures	O
these	O
qualifications	;
secondly	,
because	O
the	O
permanent	O
tenure	O
by	O
which	O
the	O
appointments	O
are	O
held	O
in	O
that	O
department	,
must	O
soon	O
destroy	O
all	O
sense	O
of	O
dependence	O
on	O
the	O
authority	O
conferring	O
them	.

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O
equally	O
evident	,
that	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
each	O
department	O
should	O
be	O
as	O
little	O
dependent	O
as	O
possible	O
on	O
those	O
of	O
the	O
others	,
for	O
the	O
emoluments	O
annexed	O
to	O
their	O
offices	.
were	O
the	O
executive	O
magistrate	,
or	O
the	O
judges	,
not	O
independent	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	O
in	O
this	O
particular	,
their	O
independence	O
in	O
every	O
other	O
would	O
be	O
merely	O
nominal	.
but	O
the	O
great	O
security	O
against	O
a	O
gradual	O
concentration	O
of	O
the	O
several	O
powers	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
department	,
consists	O
in	O
giving	O
to	O
those	O
who	O
administer	O
each	O
department	O
the	O
necessary	O
constitutional	O
means	O
and	O
personal	O
motives	O
to	O
resist	O
encroachments	O
of	O

the	O
provision	O
for	O
defense	O
must	O
in	O
this	,
as	O
in	O
all	O
other	O
cases	,
be	O
made	O
commensurate	O
to	O
the	O
danger	O
of	O

ambition	O
must	O
be	O
made	O
to	O

ambition	.
the	O

of	O

must	O
be	O
connected	O
with	O
the	O
constitutional	O
rights	O
of	O
the	O

it	O
may	O
be	O
a	O
reflection	O
on	O
human	O
nature	,
that	O
such	O
devices	O
should	O
be	O
necessary	O
to	O
control	O
the	O
abuses	O
of	O
government	.
but	O
what	O
is	O
government	O
itself	,
but	O
the	O
greatest	O
of	O
all	O
reflections	O
on	O
human	O
nature	?
if	O
men	O
were	O
angels	,
no	O
government	O
would	O
be	O
necessary	.
if	O
angels	O
were	O
to	O
govern	O
men	,
neither	O
external	O
nor	O
internal	O
controls	O
on	O
government	O
would	O
be	O
necessary	.
in	O
framing	O
a	O
government	O
which	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
administered	O
by	O
men	O
over	O
men	,
the	O
great	O
difficulty	O
lies	O
in	O
this	:
you	O
must	O
first	O
enable	O
the	O
government	O
to	O
control	O
the	O
governed	;
and	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
place	O
oblige	O
it	O
to	O
control	O
itself	.

<bos>	O
a	O
dependence	O
on	O
the	O
people	O
is	,
no	O
doubt	,
the	O
primary	O
control	O
on	O
the	O
government	;
but	O
experience	O
has	O
taught	O
mankind	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
auxiliary	O
precautions	.
this	O
policy	O
of	O
supplying	,
by	O
opposite	O
and	O
rival	O
interests	,
the	O
defect	O
of	O
better	O
motives	,
might	O
be	O
traced	O
through	O
the	O
whole	O
system	O
of	O
human	O
affairs	,
private	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
public	.
we	O
see	O
it	O
particularly	O
displayed	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
subordinate	O
distributions	O
of	O
power	,
where	O
the	O
constant	O
aim	O
is	O
to	O
divide	O
and	O
arrange	O
the	O
several	O
offices	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
as	O
that	O
each	O
may	O
be	O
a	O
check	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
that	O
the	O
private	O
interest	O
of	O
every	O
individual	O
may	O
be	O
a	O
sentinel	O
over	O
the	O
public	O
rights	.
these	O
inventions	O
of	O
prudence	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
less	O
requisite	O
in	O
the	O
distribution	O
of	O
the	O
supreme	O
powers	O
of	O
the	O
state	.
but	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
possible	O
to	O
give	O
to	O
each	O
department	O
an	O
equal	O
power	O
of	O
self-defense	.
in	O
republican	O
government	,
the	O
legislative	O
authority	O
necessarily	O
predominates	.
the	O
remedy	O
for	O
this	O
inconveniency	O
is	O
to	O
divide	O
the	O
legislature	O
into	O
different	O
branches	;
and	O
to	O
render	O
them	,
by	O
different	O
modes	O
of	O
election	O
and	O
different	O
principles	O
of	O
action	,
as	O
little	O
connected	O
with	O
each	O
other	O
as	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
their	O
common	O
functions	O
and	O
their	O
common	O
dependence	O
on	O
the	O
society	O
will	O
admit	.
it	O
may	O
even	O
be	O
necessary	O
to	O
guard	O
against	O
dangerous	O
encroachments	O
by	O
still	O
further	O
precautions	.
as	O
the	O
weight	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
authority	O
requires	O
that	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
thus	O
divided	,
the	O
weakness	O
of	O
the	O
executive	O
may	O
require	,
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	,
that	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
fortified	.

<bos>	O
an	O
absolute	O
negative	O
on	O
the	O
legislature	O
appears	,
at	O
first	O
view	,
to	O
be	O
the	O
natural	O
defense	O
with	O
which	O
the	O
executive	O
magistrate	O
should	O
be	O
armed	.
but	O
perhaps	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
neither	O
altogether	O
safe	O
nor	O
alone	O
sufficient	.
on	O
ordinary	O
occasions	O
it	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
exerted	O
with	O
the	O
requisite	O
firmness	,
and	O
on	O
extraordinary	O
occasions	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
perfidiously	O
abused	.
may	O
not	O
this	O
defect	O
of	O
an	O
absolute	O
negative	O
be	O
supplied	O
by	O
some	O
qualified	O
connection	O
between	O
this	O
weaker	O
department	O
and	O
the	O
weaker	O
branch	O
of	O
the	O
stronger	O
department	,
by	O
which	O
the	O
latter	O
may	O
be	O
led	O
to	O
support	O
the	O
constitutional	O
rights	O
of	O
the	O
former	,
without	O
being	O
too	O
much	O
detached	O
from	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
its	O
own	O
department	?
if	O
the	O
principles	O
on	O
which	O
these	O
observations	O
are	O
founded	O
be	O
just	,
as	O
i	O
persuade	O
myself	O
they	O
are	,
and	O
they	O
be	O
applied	O
as	O
a	O
criterion	O
to	O
the	O
several	O
state	O
constitutions	,
and	O
to	O
the	O
federal	O
constitution	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
found	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
latter	O
does	O
not	O
perfectly	O
correspond	O
with	O
them	,
the	O
former	O
are	O
infinitely	O
less	O
able	O
to	O
bear	O
such	O
a	O
test	.

<bos>	O
there	O
are	,
moreover	,
two	O
considerations	O
particularly	O
applicable	O
to	O
the	O
federal	O
system	O
of	O
america	,
which	O
place	O
that	O
system	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
interesting	O
point	O
of	O
view	.
first	.
in	O
a	O
single	O
republic	,
all	O
the	O
power	O
surrendered	O
by	O
the	O
people	O
is	O
submitted	O
to	O
the	O
administration	O
of	O
a	O
single	O
government	;
and	O
the	O
usurpations	O
are	O
guarded	O
against	O
by	O
a	O
division	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
into	O
distinct	O
and	O
separate	O
departments	.
in	O
the	O
compound	O
republic	O
of	O
america	,
the	O
power	O
surrendered	O
by	O
the	O
people	O
is	O
first	O
divided	O
between	O
two	O
distinct	O
governments	,
and	O
then	O
the	O
portion	O
allotted	O
to	O
each	O
subdivided	O
among	O
distinct	O
and	O
separate	O
departments	.
hence	O
a	O
double	O
security	O
arises	O
to	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
the	O
people	.
the	O
different	O
governments	O
will	O
control	O
each	O
other	,
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
that	O
each	O
will	O
be	O
controlled	O
by	O
itself	.
second	.
it	O
is	O
of	O
great	O
importance	O
in	O
a	O
republic	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
guard	O
the	O
society	O
against	O
the	O
oppression	O
of	O
its	O
rulers	,
but	O
to	O
guard	O
one	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
society	O
against	O
the	O
injustice	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
part	.
different	O
interests	O
necessarily	O
exist	O
in	O
different	O
classes	O
of	O
citizens	.
if	O
a	O
majority	O
be	O
united	O
by	O
a	O
common	O
interest	,
the	O
rights	O
of	O
the	O
minority	O
will	O
be	O
insecure	.

<bos>	O
there	O
are	O
but	O
two	O
methods	O
of	O
providing	O
against	O
this	O
evil	:
the	O
one	O
by	O
creating	O
a	O
will	O
in	O
the	O
community	O
independent	O
of	O
the	O
majority	O
that	O
is	,
of	O
the	O
society	O
itself	;
the	O
other	,
by	O
comprehending	O
in	O
the	O
society	O
so	O
many	O
separate	O
descriptions	O
of	O
citizens	O
as	O
will	O
render	O
an	O
unjust	O
combination	O
of	O
a	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
very	O
improbable	,
if	O
not	O
impracticable	.
the	O
first	O
method	O
prevails	O
in	O
all	O
governments	O
possessing	O
an	O
hereditary	O
or	O
self-appointed	O
authority	.
this	,
at	O
best	,
is	O
but	O
a	O
precarious	O
security	;
because	O
a	O
power	O
independent	O
of	O
the	O
society	O
may	O
as	O
well	O
espouse	O
the	O
unjust	O
views	O
of	O
the	O
major	,
as	O
the	O
rightful	O
interests	O
of	O
the	O
minor	O
party	,
and	O
may	O
possibly	O
be	O
turned	O
against	O
both	O
parties	.
the	O
second	O
method	O
will	O
be	O
exemplified	O
in	O
the	O
federal	O
republic	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	.
whilst	O
all	O
authority	O
in	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
derived	O
from	O
and	O
dependent	O
on	O
the	O
society	,
the	O
society	O
itself	O
will	O
be	O
broken	O
into	O
so	O
many	O
parts	,
interests	,
and	O
classes	O
of	O
citizens	,
that	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
individuals	,
or	O
of	O
the	O
minority	,
will	O
be	O
in	O
little	O
danger	O
from	O
interested	O
combinations	O
of	O
the	O
majority	.

<bos>	O
in	O
a	O
free	O
government	O
the	O
security	O
for	O
civil	O
rights	O
must	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
as	O
that	O
for	O
religious	O
rights	.
it	O
consists	O
in	O
the	O
one	O
case	O
in	O
the	O
multiplicity	O
of	O
interests	,
and	O
in	O
the	O
other	O
in	O
the	O
multiplicity	O
of	O
sects	.
the	O
degree	O
of	O
security	O
in	O
both	O
cases	O
will	O
depend	O
on	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
interests	O
and	O
sects	;
and	O
this	O
may	O
be	O
presumed	O
to	O
depend	O
on	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
country	O
and	O
number	O
of	O
people	O
comprehended	O
under	O
the	O
same	O
government	.
this	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
subject	O
must	O
particularly	O
recommend	O
a	O
proper	O
federal	O
system	O
to	O
all	O
the	O
sincere	O
and	O
considerate	O
friends	O
of	O
republican	O
government	,
since	O
it	O
shows	O
that	O
in	O
exact	O
proportion	O
as	O
the	O
territory	O
of	O
the	O
union	O
may	O
be	O
formed	O
into	O
more	O
circumscribed	O
confederacies	,
or	O
states	O
oppressive	O
combinations	O
of	O
a	O
majority	O
will	O
be	O
facilitated	:
the	O
best	O
security	,
under	O
the	O
republican	O
forms	,
for	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
every	O
class	O
of	O
citizens	,
will	O
be	O
diminished	:
and	O
consequently	O
the	O
stability	O
and	O
independence	O
of	O
some	O
member	O
of	O
the	O
government	,
the	O
only	O
other	O
security	,
must	O
be	O
proportionately	O
increased	.

the	O
end	O
of	O

ever	O
has	O

will	O
be	O
pursued	O
until	O
it	O
be	O

or	O
until	O

in	O
a	O

the	O

of	O
which	O
the	O
stronger	O
faction	O
can	O
readily	O
unite	O
and	O
oppress	O
the	O
weaker	,
anarchy	O
may	O
as	O
truly	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
reign	O
as	O
in	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
nature	,
where	O
the	O
weaker	O
individual	O
is	O
not	O
secured	O
against	O
the	O
violence	O
of	O
the	O
stronger	;
and	O
as	,
in	O
the	O
latter	O
state	,
even	O
the	O
stronger	O
individuals	O
are	O
prompted	,
by	O
the	O
uncertainty	O
of	O
their	O
condition	,
to	O
submit	O
to	O
a	O
government	O
which	O
may	O
protect	O
the	O
weak	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
themselves	;
so	,
in	O
the	O
former	O
state	,
will	O
the	O
more	O
powerful	O
factions	O
or	O
parties	O
be	O
gradnally	O
induced	,
by	O
a	O
like	O
motive	,
to	O
wish	O
for	O
a	O
government	O
which	O
will	O
protect	O
all	O

<bos>	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
little	O
doubted	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
rhode	O
island	O
was	O
separated	O
from	O
the	O
confederacy	O
and	O
left	O
to	O
itself	,
the	O
insecurity	O
of	O
rights	O
under	O
the	O
popular	O
form	O
of	O
government	O
within	O
such	O
narrow	O
limits	O
would	O
be	O
displayed	O
by	O
such	O
reiterated	O
oppressions	O
of	O
factious	O
majorities	O
that	O
some	O
power	O
altogether	O
independent	O
of	O
the	O

would	O
soon	O
be	O
called	O
for	O
by	O
the	O
voice	O
of	O
the	O
very	O
factions	O
whose	O
misrule	O

the	O
necessity	O
of	O
it	.
in	O
the	O

among	O
the	O
great	O

of	O

which	O
it	O
embraces	,
a	O
coalition	O
of	O
a	O

very	O
justly	O

a	O

and	O
for	O
the	O
additional	O
reason	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
rendered	O
too	O
dependent	O
on	O
the	O
state	O
governments	O
that	O
branch	O
of	O
the	O
federal	O
government	O
which	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
dependent	O
on	O
the	O
people	O
alone	.
to	O
have	O
reduced	O
the	O
different	O
qualifications	O
in	O
the	O
different	O
states	O
to	O
one	O
uniform	O
rule	,
would	O
probably	O
have	O
been	O
as	O
dissatisfactory	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
states	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
difficult	O
to	O
the	O
convention	.
the	O
provision	O
made	O
by	O
the	O
convention	O
appears	,
therefore	,
to	O
be	O
the	O
best	O
that	O
lay	O
within	O
their	O
option	.

<bos>	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
satisfactory	O
to	O
every	O

it	O
is	O
conformable	O

the	O

already	O
established	,

which	O
may	O
be	O
established	,
by	O
the	O

it	O
will	O
be	O
safe	O
to	O
the	O
united	O
states	,
because	,
being	O
fixed	O
by	O
the	O
state	O
constitutions	,
it	O
is	O
not	O
alterable	O
by	O
the	O
state	O

and	O
it	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
feared	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O

will	O
alter	O
this	O
part	O

to	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

less	O
carefully	O

properly	O
defined	O
by	O
the	O
state	O
constitutions	,
and	O
being	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
more	O
susceptible	O
of	O
uniformity	,
have	O
been	O
very	O
properly	O
considered	O

of	O

must	O

seven	O

of	O

an	O

must	O
be	O
in	O

these	O
reasonable	O
limitations	,
the	O
door	O
of	O
this	O

<bos>	O
the	O
term	O
for	O
which	O
the	O
representatives	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
elected	O
falls	O
under	O
a	O
second	O
view	O
which	O
may	O
be	O
taken	O
of	O
this	O
branch	.
in	O
order	O
to	O
decide	O
on	O
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
this	O
article	,
two	O
questions	O
must	O
be	O
considered	:
first	,
whether	O
biennial	O
elections	O
will	,
in	O
this	O
case	,
be	O
safe	;
secondly	,
whether	O
they	O
be	O
necessary	O
or	O
useful	.
first	.
as	O
it	O
is	O
essential	O
to	O
liberty	O
that	O
the	O
government	O
in	O
general	O
should	O
have	O
a	O
common	O
interest	O
with	O
the	O
people	,
so	O
it	O
is	O
particularly	O
essential	O
that	O
the	O
branch	O
of	O
it	O
under	O
consideration	O
should	O
have	O
an	O
immediate	O
dependence	O
on	,
and	O
an	O
intimate	O
sympathy	O
with	,
the	O
people	.
frequent	O
elections	O
are	O
unquestionably	O
the	O
only	O
policy	O
by	O
which	O
this	O
dependence	O
and	O
sympathy	O
can	O
be	O
effectually	O
secured	.
but	O
what	O
particular	O
degree	O
of	O
frequency	O
may	O
be	O
absolutely	O
necessary	O
for	O
the	O
purpose	,
does	O
not	O
appear	O
to	O
be	O
susceptible	O
of	O
any	O
precise	O
calculation	,
and	O
must	O
depend	O
on	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
circumstances	O
with	O
which	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
connected	.

<bos>	O
let	O
us	O
consult	O
experience	,
the	O
guide	O
that	O
ought	O
always	O
to	O
be	O
followed	O
whenever	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
found	.
the	O
scheme	O
of	O
representation	,
as	O
a	O
substitute	O
for	O
a	O
meeting	O
of	O
the	O
citizens	O
in	O
person	,
being	O
at	O
most	O
but	O
very	O
imperfectly	O
known	O
to	O
ancient	O
polity	,
it	O
is	O
in	O
more	O
modern	O
times	O
only	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
to	O
expect	O
instructive	O
examples	.
and	O
even	O
here	,
in	O
order	O
to	O
avoid	O
a	O
research	O
too	O
vague	O
and	O
diffusive	,
it	O
will	O
be	O
proper	O
to	O
confine	O
ourselves	O
to	O
the	O
few	O
examples	O
which	O
are	O
best	O
known	,
and	O
which	O
bear	O
the	O
greatest	O
analogy	O
to	O
our	O
particular	O
case	.
the	O
first	O
to	O
which	O
this	O
character	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
applied	,
is	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
commons	O
in	O
great	O
britain	.
the	O
history	O
of	O
this	O
branch	O
of	O
the	O
english	O
constitution	,
anterior	O
to	O
the	O
date	O
of	O
magna	O
charta	,
is	O
too	O
obscure	O
to	O
yield	O
instruction	.
the	O
very	O
existence	O
of	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
made	O
a	O
question	O
among	O
political	O
antiquaries	.
the	O
earliest	O
records	O
of	O
subsequent	O
date	O
prove	O
that	O
parliaments	O
were	O
to	O
sit	O
only	O
every	O
year	;
not	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
elected	O
every	O
year	.
and	O
even	O
these	O
annual	O
sessions	O
were	O
left	O
so	O
much	O
at	O
the	O
discretion	O
of	O
the	O
monarch	,
that	,
under	O
various	O
pretexts	,
very	O
long	O
and	O
dangerous	O
intermissions	O
were	O
often	O
contrived	O
by	O
royal	O
ambition	.
to	O
remedy	O
this	O
grievance	,
it	O
was	O
provided	O
by	O
a	O
statute	O
in	O
the	O
reign	O
of	O
charles	O
ii	.
that	O
the	O
intermissions	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
protracted	O
beyond	O
a	O
period	O
of	O
three	O
years	.
on	O
the	O
accession	O
of	O
william	O
iii	.
when	O
a	O
revolution	O
took	O
place	O
in	O
the	O
government	,
the	O
subject	O
was	O
still	O
more	O
seriously	O
resumed	,
and	O
it	O
was	O
declared	O
to	O
be	O
among	O
the	O
fundamental	O
rights	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
that	O
parliaments	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
held	O
frequently	.
by	O
another	O
statute	,
which	O
passed	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
later	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
reign	,
the	O
term	O
``	O
frequently	,
''	O
which	O
had	O
alluded	O
to	O
the	O
triennial	O
period	O
settled	O
in	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
charles	O
ii	.
is	O
reduced	O
to	O
a	O
precise	O
meaning	,
it	O
being	O
expressly	O
enacted	O
that	O
a	O
new	O
parliament	O
shall	O
be	O
called	O
within	O
three	O
years	O
after	O
the	O
termination	O
of	O
the	O
former	.
the	O
last	O
change	,
from	O
three	O
to	O
seven	O
years	,
is	O
well	O
known	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
introduced	O
pretty	O
early	O
in	O
the	O
present	O
century	,
under	O
on	O
alarm	O
for	O
the	O
hanoverian	O
succession	.

<bos>	O
from	O
these	O
facts	O
it	O
appears	O
that	O
the	O
greatest	O
frequency	O
of	O
elections	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
deemed	O
necessary	O
in	O
that	O
kingdom	,
for	O
binding	O
the	O
representatives	O
to	O
their	O
constituents	,
does	O
not	O
exceed	O
a	O
triennial	O
return	O
of	O
them	.
and	O
if	O
we	O
may	O
argue	O
from	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
liberty	O
retained	O
even	O
under	O
septennial	O
elections	,
and	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
vicious	O
ingredients	O
in	O
the	O
parliamentary	O
constitution	,
we	O
can	O
not	O
doubt	O
that	O
a	O
reduction	O
of	O
the	O
period	O
from	O
seven	O
to	O
three	O
years	,
with	O
the	O
other	O
necessary	O
reforms	,
would	O
so	O
far	O
extend	O
the	O
influence	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
over	O
their	O
representatives	O
as	O
to	O
satisfy	O
us	O
that	O
biennial	O
elections	,
under	O
the	O
federal	O
system	,
can	O
not	O
possibly	O
be	O
dangerous	O
to	O
the	O
requisite	O
dependence	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	O
on	O
their	O
constituents	.
elections	O
in	O
ireland	,
till	O
of	O
late	,
were	O
regulated	O
entirely	O
by	O
the	O
discretion	O
of	O
the	O
crown	,
and	O
were	O
seldom	O
repeated	,
except	O
on	O
the	O
accession	O
of	O
a	O
new	O
prince	,
or	O
some	O
other	O
contingent	O
event	.
the	O
parliament	O
which	O
commenced	O
with	O
george	O
ii	.
was	O
continued	O
throughout	O
his	O
whole	O
reign	,
a	O
period	O
of	O
about	O
thirty-five	O
years	.
the	O
only	O
dependence	O
of	O
the	O
representatives	O
on	O
the	O
people	O
consisted	O
in	O
the	O
right	O
of	O
the	O
latter	O
to	O
supply	O
occasional	O
vacancies	O
by	O
the	O
election	O
of	O
new	O
members	,
and	O
in	O
the	O
chance	O
of	O
some	O
event	O
which	O
might	O
produce	O
a	O
general	O
new	O
election	.
the	O
ability	O
also	O
of	O
the	O
irish	O
parliament	O
to	O
maintain	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
their	O
constituents	,
so	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
disposition	O
might	O
exist	,
was	O
extremely	O
shackled	O
by	O
the	O
control	O
of	O
the	O
crown	O
over	O
the	O
subjects	O
of	O
their	O
deliberation	.
of	O
late	O
these	O
shackles	,
if	O
i	O
mistake	O
not	,
have	O
been	O
broken	;
and	O
octennial	O
parliaments	O
have	O
besides	O
been	O
established	.
what	O
effect	O
may	O
be	O
produced	O
by	O
this	O
partial	O
reform	,
must	O
be	O
left	O
to	O
further	O
experience	.
the	O
example	O
of	O
ireland	,
from	O
this	O
view	O
of	O
it	,
can	O
throw	O
but	O
little	O
light	O
on	O
the	O
subject	.
as	O
far	O
as	O
we	O
can	O
draw	O
any	O
conclusion	O
from	O
it	,
it	O
must	O
be	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
that	O
country	O
have	O
been	O
able	O
under	O
all	O
these	O
disadvantages	O
to	O
retain	O
any	O
liberty	O
whatever	,
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
biennial	O
elections	O
would	O
secure	O
to	O
them	O
every	O
degree	O
of	O
liberty	,
which	O
might	O
depend	O
on	O
a	O
due	O
connection	O
between	O
their	O
representatives	O
and	O
themselves	.
let	O
us	O
bring	O
our	O
inquiries	O
nearer	O
home	.
the	O
example	O
of	O
these	O
states	,
when	O
british	O
colonies	,
claims	O
particular	O
attention	,
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
so	O
well	O
known	O
as	O
to	O
require	O
little	O
to	O
be	O
said	O
on	O
it	.
the	O
principle	O
of	O
representation	,
in	O
one	O
branch	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	O
at	O
least	,
was	O
established	O
in	O
all	O
of	O
them	.
but	O
the	O
periods	O
of	O
election	O
were	O
different	.
they	O
varied	O
from	O
one	O
to	O
seven	O
years	.
have	O
we	O
any	O
reason	O
to	O
infer	,
from	O
the	O
spirit	O
and	O
conduct	O
of	O
the	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
prior	O
to	O
the	O
revolution	,
that	O
biennial	O
elections	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
dangerous	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
liberties	?
the	O
spirit	O
which	O
everywhere	O
displayed	O
itself	O
at	O
the	O
commencement	O
of	O
the	O
struggle	,
and	O
which	O
vanquished	O
the	O
obstacles	O
to	O
independence	,
is	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
proofs	O
that	O
a	O
sufficient	O
portion	O
of	O
liberty	O
had	O
been	O
everywhere	O
enjoyed	O
to	O
inspire	O
both	O
a	O
sense	O
of	O
its	O
worth	O
and	O
a	O
zeal	O
for	O
its	O
proper	O
enlargement	O
this	O
remark	O
holds	O
good	,
as	O
well	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
then	O
colonies	O
whose	O
elections	O
were	O
least	O
frequent	,
as	O
to	O
those	O
whose	O
elections	O
were	O
most	O
frequent	O
virginia	O
was	O
the	O
colony	O
which	O
stood	O
first	O
in	O
resisting	O
the	O
parliamentary	O
usurpations	O
of	O
great	O
britain	;
it	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
also	O
in	O
espousing	,
by	O
public	O
act	,
the	O
resolution	O
of	O
independence	.

<bos>	O
in	O
virginia	,
nevertheless	,
if	O
i	O
have	O
not	O
been	O
misinformed	,
elections	O
under	O
the	O
former	O
government	O
were	O
septennial	.
this	O
particular	O
example	O
is	O
brought	O
into	O
view	,
not	O
as	O
a	O
proof	O
of	O
any	O
peculiar	O
merit	,
for	O
the	O
priority	O
in	O
those	O
instances	O
was	O
probably	O
accidental	;
and	O
still	O
less	O
of	O
any	O
advantage	O
in	O
septennial	O
elections	,
for	O
when	O
compared	O
with	O
a	O
greater	O
frequency	O
they	O
are	O
inadmissible	;
but	O
merely	O
as	O
a	O
proof	,
and	O
i	O
conceive	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
very	O
substantial	O
proof	,
that	O
the	O
liberties	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
can	O
be	O
in	O
no	O
danger	O
from	O
biennial	O
elections	.
the	O
conclusion	O
resulting	O
from	O
these	O
examples	O
will	O
be	O
not	O
a	O
little	O
strengthened	O
by	O
recollecting	O
three	O
circumstances	.
the	O
first	O
is	,
that	O
the	O
federal	O
legislature	O
will	O
possess	O
a	O
part	O
only	O
of	O
that	O
supreme	O
legislative	O
authority	O
which	O
is	O
vested	O
completely	O
in	O
the	O
british	O
parliament	;
and	O
which	,
with	O
a	O
few	O
exceptions	,
was	O
exercised	O
by	O
the	O
colonial	O
assemblies	O
and	O
the	O
irish	O
legislature	.
it	O
is	O
a	O
received	O
and	O
well-founded	O
maxim	,
that	O
where	O
no	O
other	O
circumstances	O
affect	O
the	O
case	,
the	O
greater	O
the	O
power	O
is	,
the	O
shorter	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
its	O
duration	;
and	,
conversely	,
the	O
smaller	O
the	O
power	,
the	O
more	O
safely	O
may	O
its	O
duration	O
be	O
protracted	.
in	O
the	O
second	O
place	,
it	O
has	,
on	O
another	O
occasion	,
been	O
shown	O
that	O
the	O
federal	O
legislature	O
will	O
not	O
only	O
be	O
restrained	O
by	O
its	O
dependence	O
on	O
its	O
people	,
as	O
other	O
legislative	O
bodies	O
are	,
but	O
that	O
it	O
will	O
be	,
moreover	,
watched	O
and	O
controlled	O
by	O
the	O
several	O
collateral	O
legislatures	,
which	O
other	O
legislative	O
bodies	O
are	O
not	.
and	O
in	O
the	O
third	O
place	,
no	O
comparison	O
can	O
be	O
made	O
between	O
the	O
means	O
that	O
will	O

here	,

reminded	O

a	O

observation	,
``	O
that	O

``	O
if	O

to	O

of	O

is	O
a	O
difference	,
as	O
four	O

it	O

that	O

the	O
important	O
distinction	O
so	O

and	O
a	O
law	O
established	O
by	O
the	O

and	O
alterable	O
by	O
the	O

seems	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
little	O
understood	O
and	O
less	O
observed	O
in	O
any	O
other	O
country	.
wherever	O
the	O
supreme	O
power	O
of	O
legislation	O
has	O
resided	,
has	O

to	O
reside	O

to	O

the	O
form	O
of	O

<bos>	O
even	O
in	O
great	O
britain	,
where	O
the	O
principles	O
of	O
political	O
and	O
civil	O
liberty	O
have	O
been	O
most	O
discussed	,
and	O
where	O
we	O
hear	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	,
it	O
is	O
maintained	O
that	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
parliament	O
is	O
transcendent	O
and	O
uncontrollable	,
as	O

the	O
ordinary	O
objects	O
of	O
legislative	O
provision	.
they	O
have	O
accordingly	,
in	O
several	O
instances	,
actually	O
changed	,
by	O
legislative	O
acts	,
some	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
fundamental	O
articles	O
of	O
the	O
government	.
they	O
have	O
in	O
particular	,
on	O
several	O
occasions	,
changed	O
the	O
period	O
of	O
election	;
and	,
on	O
the	O
last	O
occasion	,
not	O
only	O
introduced	O
septennial	O
in	O
place	O
of	O
triennial	O

by	O

themselves	O
in	O

four	O
years	O
beyond	O
the	O
term	O
for	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
elected	O
by	O
the	O
people	.
an	O
attention	O
to	O
these	O
dangerous	O
practices	O
has	O
produced	O
a	O
very	O
natural	O
alarm	O
in	O
the	O
votaries	O
of	O
free	O
government	,
of	O
which	O
frequency	O
of	O
elections	O
is	O
the	O
corner-stone	;
and	O
has	O
led	O
them	O
to	O
seek	O
for	O
some	O
security	O
to	O
liberty	,
against	O
the	O
danger	O
to	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
exposed	.

<bos>	O
where	O
no	O
constitution	,
paramount	O
to	O
the	O
government	,
either	O
existed	O
or	O
could	O
be	O
obtained	,
no	O
constitutional	O
security	,
similar	O
to	O
that	O
established	O
in	O
the	O
united	O
states	,
was	O
to	O
be	O
attempted	.
some	O
other	O
security	,
therefore	,
was	O
to	O
be	O
sought	O
for	;
and	O
what	O
better	O
security	O
would	O
the	O
case	O
admit	,
than	O
that	O
of	O
selecting	O
and	O
appealing	O
to	O
some	O
simple	O
and	O
familiar	O
portion	O
of	O
time	,
as	O
a	O
standard	O
for	O
measuring	O
the	O
danger	O
of	O
innovations	,
for	O
fixing	O
the	O
national	O
sentiment	,
and	O
for	O
uniting	O
the	O
patriotic	O
exertions	?
the	O
most	O
simple	O
and	O
familiar	O
portion	O
of	O
time	,
applicable	O
to	O
the	O
subject	O
was	O
that	O
of	O
a	O
year	;
and	O
hence	O
the	O
doctrine	O
has	O
been	O
inculcated	O
by	O
a	O
laudable	O
zeal	,
to	O
erect	O
some	O
barrier	O
against	O
the	O
gradual	O
innovations	O
of	O
an	O
unlimited	O
government	,
that	O
the	O
advance	O
towards	O
tyranny	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
calculated	O
by	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
departure	O
from	O
the	O
fixed	O
point	O
of	O
annual	O
elections	.
but	O
what	O
necessity	O
can	O
there	O
be	O
of	O
applying	O
this	O
expedient	O
to	O
a	O
government	O
limited	,
as	O
the	O
federal	O
government	O
will	O
be	,
by	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
a	O
paramount	O
constitution	?
or	O
who	O
will	O
pretend	O
that	O
the	O
liberties	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
america	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
more	O
secure	O
under	O
biennial	O
elections	,
unalterably	O
fixed	O
by	O
such	O
a	O
constitution	,
than	O
those	O
of	O
any	O
other	O
nation	O
would	O
be	,
where	O
elections	O
were	O
annual	,
or	O
even	O
more	O
frequent	,
but	O
subject	O
to	O
alterations	O
by	O
the	O
ordinary	O
power	O
of	O
the	O
government	?
the	O
second	O
question	O
stated	O
is	,
whether	O
biennial	O
elections	O
be	O
necessary	O
or	O
useful	.
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
answering	O
this	O
question	O
in	O
the	O
affirmative	O
will	O
appear	O
from	O
several	O
very	O
obvious	O
considerations	.

<bos>	O
no	O
man	O
can	O
be	O
a	O
competent	O
legislator	O
who	O
does	O
not	O
add	O
to	O
an	O
upright	O
intention	O
and	O
a	O
sound	O
judgment	O
a	O
certain	O
degree	O
of	O
knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
subjects	O
on	O
which	O
he	O
is	O
to	O
legislate	.
a	O
part	O
of	O
this	O
knowledge	O
may	O
be	O
acquired	O
by	O
means	O
of	O
information	O
which	O
lie	O
within	O
the	O
compass	O
of	O
men	O
in	O
private	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
public	O
stations	.
another	O
part	O
can	O
only	O
be	O
attained	,
or	O
at	O
least	O
thoroughly	O
attained	,
by	O
actual	O
experience	O
in	O
the	O
station	O
which	O
requires	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
it	.
the	O
period	O
of	O
service	,
ought	,
therefore	,
in	O
all	O
such	O
cases	,
to	O
bear	O
some	O
proportion	O
to	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
practical	O
knowledge	O
requisite	O
to	O
the	O
due	O
performance	O
of	O
the	O
service	.
the	O
period	O
of	O
legislative	O
service	O
established	O
in	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
states	O
for	O
the	O
more	O
numerous	O
branch	O
is	,
as	O
we	O
have	O
seen	,
one	O
year	.
the	O
question	O
then	O
may	O
be	O
put	O
into	O
this	O
simple	O
form	:
does	O
the	O
period	O
of	O
two	O
years	O
bear	O
no	O
greater	O
proportion	O
to	O
the	O
knowledge	O
requisite	O
for	O
federal	O
legislation	O
than	O
one	O
year	O
does	O
to	O
the	O
knowledge	O
requisite	O
for	O
state	O
legislation	?
the	O
very	O
statement	O
of	O
the	O
question	,
in	O
this	O
form	,
suggests	O
the	O
answer	O
that	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
given	O
to	O
it	.
in	O
a	O
single	O
state	,
the	O
requisite	O
knowledge	O
relates	O
to	O
the	O
existing	O
laws	O
which	O
are	O
uniform	O
throughout	O
the	O
state	,
and	O
with	O
which	O
all	O
the	O
citizens	O
are	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
conversant	;
and	O
to	O
the	O
general	O
affairs	O
of	O
the	O
state	,
which	O
lie	O
within	O
a	O
small	O
compass	,
are	O
not	O
very	O

and	O
occupy	O
much	O

of	O

<bos>	O
the	O

a	O
very	O
different	O

the	O
laws	O
are	O
so	O
far	O
from	O
being	O
uniform	,
that	O
they	O
vary	O
in	O

by	O

the	O
next	O
view	O

take	O
of	O
the	O

relates	O
to	O
the	O
appointment	O
of	O
its	O
members	O
to	O
the	O
several	O
states	O
which	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
determined	O
by	O
the	O
same	O
rule	O
with	O
that	O
of	O
direct	O
taxes	.

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
contended	O
that	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
people	O
in	O
each	O
state	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
standard	O

the	O
establishment	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
rule	O
for	O
the	O
appointment	O
of	O
taxes	,
will	O
probably	O
be	O
as	O
little	O
contested	;
though	O
the	O
rule	O
itself	O
in	O
this	O
case	,
is	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
founded	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
principle	.
in	O
the	O
former	O
case	,
the	O
rule	O
is	O
understood	O
to	O
refer	O
to	O
the	O
personal	O
rights	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
with	O
which	O
it	O
has	O
a	O
natural	O
and	O
universal	O
connection	.
in	O
the	O
latter	,
it	O
has	O
reference	O
to	O
the	O
proportion	O
of	O
wealth	,
of	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
in	O
no	O
case	O
a	O
precise	O
measure	,
and	O
in	O
ordinary	O
cases	O
a	O
very	O
unfit	O
one	.
but	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O
imperfection	O
of	O
the	O
rule	O
as	O
applied	O
to	O
the	O
relative	O
wealth	O
and	O
contributions	O
of	O
the	O
states	,
it	O
is	O
evidently	O
the	O
least	O
objectionable	O
among	O
the	O
practicable	O
rules	,
and	O
had	O
too	O
recently	O
obtained	O
the	O
general	O
sanction	O
of	O
america	,
not	O
to	O
have	O
found	O
a	O
ready	O
preference	O
with	O
the	O
convention	.

<bos>	O
all	O
this	O
is	O
admitted	,
it	O
will	O
perhaps	O
be	O
said	;
but	O
does	O
it	O
follow	,
from	O
an	O
admission	O
of	O
numbers	O
for	O
the	O
measure	O
of	O
representation	,
or	O
of	O
slaves	O
combined	O
with	O
free	O
citizens	O
as	O
a	O
ratio	O
of	O
taxation	,
that	O
slaves	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
included	O
in	O
the	O
numerical	O
rule	O
of	O
representation	?
slaves	O
are	O
considered	O
as	O
property	,
not	O
as	O
persons	.
they	O
ought	O
therefore	O
to	O
be	O
comprehended	O
in	O
estimates	O
of	O
taxation	O
which	O
are	O
founded	O
on	O
property	,
and	O
to	O
be	O
excluded	O
from	O
representation	O
which	O
is	O
regulated	O
by	O
a	O
census	O
of	O
persons	.
this	O
is	O
the	O
objection	,

it	,

its	O
full	O
force	.

we	O

regarded	O

it	O

the	O

adopted	,
which	O

as	O
debased	O
by	O

below	O
the	O

it	O

that	O

in	O

to	O

the	O
charges	O

it	O
are	,
first	,
that	O
so	O
small	O
a	O
number	O

be	O

fourthly	,
that	O
defective	O
as	O
the	O

in	O
the	O
first	O

it	O
will	O
be	O
more	O

more	O

<bos>	O
in	O
general	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
remarked	O
on	O
this	O
subject	,
that	O
no	O
political	O
problem	O
is	O
less	O
susceptible	O
of	O
a	O
precise	O
solution	O
than	O
that	O
which	O
relates	O
to	O
the	O
number	O
most	O
convenient	O
for	O
a	O
representative	O
legislature	;
nor	O
is	O
there	O
any	O
point	O
on	O
which	O
the	O
policy	O
of	O
the	O
several	O
states	O
is	O
more	O
at	O
variance	,
whether	O
we	O
compare	O
their	O
legislative	O
assemblies	O
directly	O
with	O
each	O
other	,
or	O
consider	O
the	O
proportions	O
which	O
they	O
respectively	O
bear	O

the	O
number	O
of	O

passing	O
over	O
the	O
difference	O
between	O
the	O
smallest	O
and	O
largest	O
states	,
as	O
delaware	,
whose	O
most	O
numerous	O
branch	O
consists	O
of	O
twenty-one	O

and	O
massachusetts	,
where	O
it	O
amounts	O
to	O
between	O
three	O
and	O
four	O

a	O
very	O
considerable	O
difference	O
is	O
observable	O
among	O
states	O

in	O
population	.
the	O
number	O
of	O
representatives	O
in	O
pennsylvania	O
is	O
not	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
fifth	O
of	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
state	O

whose	O
population	O
is	O
to	O
that	O

little	O
more	O
than	O
one	O

of	O
the	O
number	O
of	O

as	O

a	O

prevails	O
between	O
the	O
states	O
of	O
georgia	O
and	O
delaware	O
or	O
rhode	O
island	.
in	O
pennsylvania	,
the	O
representatives	O
do	O
not	O
bear	O
a	O
greater	O
proportion	O
to	O
their	O

than	O
of	O
one	O
for	O
every	O
four	O

they	O
bear	O
a	O
proportion	O
of	O
at	O

one	O
for	O
every	O
thousand	.
and	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
georgia	,
the	O
proportion	O
may	O
be	O
carried	O
to	O
one	O
to	O
every	O
ten	O

and	O
must	O
unavoidably	O
far	O
exceed	O
the	O
proportion	O
in	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
states	.

<bos>	O
another	O
general	O
remark	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
is	,
that	O
the	O
ratio	O
between	O
the	O
representatives	O
and	O
the	O
people	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
where	O
the	O
latter	O
are	O
very	O
numerous	O
as	O
where	O
they	O
are	O
very	O
few	.
were	O
the	O
representatives	O
in	O
virginia	O
to	O
be	O
regulated	O
by	O
the	O
standard	O
in	O
rhode	O
island	,
they	O
would	,
at	O
this	O
time	,
amount	O
to	O
between	O
four	O
and	O
five	O
hundred	;
and	O
twenty	O
or	O
thirty	O
years	O
hence	,
to	O
a	O
thousand	.
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	,
the	O
ratio	O
of	O
pennsylvania	,
if	O
applied	O
to	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
delaware	,
would	O
reduce	O
the	O
representative	O
assembly	O
of	O
the	O
latter	O
to	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
members	.
nothing	O
can	O
be	O
more	O
fallacious	O
than	O
to	O
found	O
our	O
political	O
calculations	O
on	O
arithmetical	O
principles	.
sixty	O
or	O
seventy	O
men	O
may	O
be	O
more	O
properly	O
trusted	O
with	O
a	O
given	O
degree	O
of	O
power	O
than	O
six	O
or	O
seven	.
but	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
follow	O
that	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
hundred	O
would	O
be	O
proportionably	O
a	O
better	O
depositary	.
and	O
if	O
we	O
carry	O
on	O
the	O
supposition	O
to	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
thousand	,
the	O
whole	O
reasoning	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
reversed	.
the	O
truth	O

that	O
in	O

here	O
the	O
observations	O
which	O
were	O

to	O
the	O
case	O
of	O

than	O
the	O

safely	O
might	O
otherwise	O
require	,
the	O
members	O

with	O
these	O

ideas	O
in	O

let	O
us	O
weigh	O
the	O
objections	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
stated	O
against	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
members	O
proposed	O
for	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	.
it	O
is	O
said	,
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	,
that	O
so	O
small	O
a	O
number	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
safely	O
trusted	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
power	.
the	O
number	O
of	O
which	O
this	O
branch	O
of	O
the	O

is	O
to	O
consist	,
at	O
the	O
outset	O
of	O
the	O

be	O
sixtyfive	.
within	O
three	O
years	O
a	O
census	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
taken	,
when	O
the	O
number	O
may	O
be	O
augmented	O
to	O
one	O
for	O
every	O
thirty	O
thousand	O
inhabitants	;
and	O
within	O
every	O
successive	O
period	O
of	O
ten	O
years	O
the	O
census	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
renewed	,
and	O
augmentations	O
may	O
continue	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
under	O
the	O
above	O
limitation	.
it	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
thought	O
an	O
extravagant	O
conjecture	O
that	O
the	O
first	O
census	O
will	,
at	O
the	O
rate	O
of	O
one	O
for	O
every	O
thirty	O
thousand	,
raise	O
the	O
number	O
of	O

to	O
at	O

one	O
hundred	.
estimating	O
the	O
negroes	O
in	O
the	O
proportion	O
of	O
three	O
fifths	,
it	O
can	O
scarcely	O
be	O
doubted	O
that	O
the	O
population	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
will	O
by	O
that	O
time	,
if	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
already	,
amount	O
to	O
three	O
millions	.
at	O
the	O
expiration	O
of	O
twenty-five	O
years	,
according	O
to	O
the	O
computed	O
rate	O
of	O
increase	,
the	O
number	O
of	O
representatives	O
will	O
amount	O
to	O
two	O
hundred	,
and	O
of	O
fifty	O
years	,
to	O
four	O
hundred	.
this	O
is	O
a	O
number	O
which	,
i	O
presume	,
will	O
put	O
an	O
end	O
to	O
all	O
fears	O
arising	O
from	O
the	O
smallness	O
of	O
the	O
body.i	O
take	O
for	O
granted	O
here	O
what	O
i	O
shall	,
in	O
answering	O
the	O
fourth	O
objection	,
hereafter	O
show	,
that	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
representatives	O
will	O
be	O
augmented	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time	O
in	O
the	O
manner	O

by	O
the	O

<bos>	O
on	O
a	O
contrary	O
supposition	,
i	O
should	O
admit	O
the	O
objection	O
to	O
have	O
very	O
great	O
weight	O
indeed	.
the	O
true	O
question	O
to	O
be	O
decided	O
then	O
is	,
whether	O
the	O
smallness	O
of	O
the	O
number	,
as	O
a	O
temporary	O
regulation	,
be	O
dangerous	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
liberty	?
whether	O
sixty-five	O
members	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
years	,
and	O
a	O
hundred	O
or	O
two	O
hundred	O

for	O
a	O

i	O
must	O
own	O
that	O
i	O
could	O
not	O
give	O
a	O

under	O

a	O

i	O
am	O
unable	O
to	O
conceive	O
that	O
the	O
state	O

which	O
must	O
feel	O
so	O
many	O

to	O

which	O
possess	O
so	O

defeat	O
a	O

of	O
the	O

against	O

i	O
am	O
equally	O
unable	O
to	O
conceive	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
at	O
this	O

or	O
can	O
be	O
in	O
any	O
short	O

sixty-five	O

the	O

within	O

two	O

to	O

what	O

of	O
circumstances	,

a	O

a	O

the	O

state	O
of	O

i	O
must	O
pronounce	O
that	O
the	O
liberties	O

can	O
not	O
be	O
unsafe	O
in	O
the	O
number	O
of	O

from	O
what	O
quarter	O
can	O
the	O
danger	O
proceed	?
are	O
we	O
afraid	O
of	O
foreign	O
gold	?
if	O
foreign	O
gold	O
could	O
so	O

corrupt	O
our	O
federal	O
rulers	O

enable	O
them	O
to	O
ensnare	O

how	O

it	O
happened	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
at	O
this	O

a	O
free	O

nation	?
the	O
congress	O
which	O
conducted	O
us	O
through	O
the	O
revolution	O
was	O
a	O
less	O
numerous	O
body	O
than	O
their	O
successors	O

be	;
they	O
were	O
not	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

for	O
a	O

they	O
held	O
their	O
consultations	O
always	O
under	O
the	O

it	O

to	O

hoped	O

ever	O
be	O
the	O
case	O
with	O
our	O

and	O
from	O
the	O
greatness	O
of	O
the	O
prize	O
at	O

and	O
the	O
eagerness	O
of	O
the	O
party	O
which	O
lost	O
it	,
it	O
may	O
well	O
be	O
supposed	O
that	O
the	O
use	O
of	O

yet	O
we	O

by	O

that	O
the	O

the	O

apprehended	O
from	O
the	O

where	O
are	O
the	O

to	O

by	O
the	O

the	O

both	?
their	O

it	O
is	O
to	O

and	O
without	O
a	O

of	O
the	O

can	O
not	,
more	O

for	O
very	O

the	O

then	,
which	O
they	O
can	O
possess	,
will	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
dispensation	O
of	O

is	O
it	O
here	O
that	O
suspicion	O
rests	O
her	O

sometimes	O
we	O
are	O
told	O
that	O
this	O

of	O

is	O
to	O
be	O
exhausted	O
by	O
the	O

in	O
subduing	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

<bos>	O
now	,
the	O
fidelity	O
of	O
the	O
other	O

is	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
victim	.
the	O
improbability	O
of	O
such	O
a	O

combination	O
of	O

several	O

standing	O
on	O

over	O
which	O
they	O
are	O

this	O
apprehension	.
but	,
fortunately	,
the	O

a	O
still	O
further	O

the	O

<bos>	O
the	O
second	O
charge	O
against	O
the	O
house	O
of	O

that	O
it	O

as	O
this	O
objection	O

to	O
it	O

a	O
brief	O
explanation	O
of	O

it	O
is	O
a	O

which	O

<bos>	O
a	O
proper	O

of	O

requires	O
much	O
information	,
as	O
has	O

the	O

applicable	O
to	O

as	O

as	O
it	O

that	O

in	O

which	O
would	O
very	O
much	O
shorten	O
the	O

of	O

and	O
render	O
a	O
much	O

number	O
of	O

sufficient	O
for	O
it	?
the	O
federal	O

will	O
derive	O
great	O
advantage	O
from	O
another	O
circumstance	.
the	O
representatives	O
of	O
each	O

will	O
not	O
only	O
bring	O
with	O
them	O
a	O
considerable	O
knowledge	O
of	O
its	O
laws	,
and	O
a	O
local	O
knowledge	O
of	O

from	O

the	O

that	O
the	O
reasoning	O
here	O
used	,
to	O
prove	O
the	O
sufficiency	O
of	O
a	O

number	O
of	O

not	O
in	O

with	O

to	O
the	O

which	O

ought	O
to	O
possess	,
and	O
the	O

that	O
might	O

for	O

it	.

<bos>	O
this	O
information	,
so	O
far	O
as	O
it	O
may	O
relate	O
to	O
local	O
objects	,
is	O
rendered	O
necessary	O
and	O
difficult	,
not	O
by	O
a	O
difference	O
of	O
laws	O
and	O
local	O
circumstances	O
within	O
a	O

of	O
those	O

taking	O
each	O

by	O
itself	,
its	O
laws	O
are	O
the	O

and	O
its	O
interests	O
but	O
little	O

a	O
few	O

therefore	,
will	O
possess	O
all	O
the	O

requisite	O
for	O
a	O

were	O
the	O

of	O
each	O

perfectly	O
simple	O

a	O
knowledge	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
one	O

would	O
involve	O
a	O
knowledge	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
every	O
other	,
and	O
the	O
whole	O

might	O
be	O

by	O
a	O

from	O
any	O
part	O
of	O

on	O
a	O
comparison	O
of	O
the	O
different	O
states	O
together	,
we	O
find	O
a	O
great	O
dissimilarity	O
in	O
their	O
laws	,
and	O
in	O
many	O
other	O
circumstances	O
connected	O
with	O
the	O
objects	O
of	O
federal	O
legislation	,
with	O
all	O
of	O
which	O
the	O
federal	O
representatives	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
acquaintance	.
whilst	O
a	O
few	O
representatives	,
therefore	,
from	O
each	O
state	,
may	O
bring	O
with	O
them	O
a	O
due	O
knowledge	O
of	O
their	O
own	O

every	O
representative	O
will	O
have	O
much	O
information	O
to	O

effect	O
of	O

on	O
the	O

of	O

be	O
just	O
the	O

at	O

some	O
of	O
the	O

are	O
little	O
more	O
than	O
a	O

of	O

they	O

more	O
than	O
a	O

deduction	O
from	O
the	O

we	O
will	,

it	O

that	O
a	O

that	O
the	O

chargeable	,
in	O

that	O
of	O
the	O
house	O

as	O
above	O
explained	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
give	O
the	O
fullest	O
assurance	,
that	O
a	O

<bos>	O
the	O
third	O
charge	O
against	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	O
is	,
that	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
taken	O
from	O
that	O

of	O

which	O
will	O
have	O

sympathy	O
with	O
the	O

of	O
all	O
the	O
objections	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
framed	O
against	O
the	O
federal	O
constitution	,
this	O
is	O
perhaps	O
the	O
most	O
extraordinary	.
whilst	O
the	O
objection	O
itself	O
is	O
levelled	O
against	O
a	O
pretended	O
oligarchy	,
the	O
principle	O
of	O
it	O
strikes	O
at	O
the	O
very	O
root	O
of	O
republican	O
government	.
the	O
aim	O
of	O
every	O

is	,
or	O

to	O

first	O
to	O

for	O

to	O

in	O

the	O

of	O

is	O
the	O

of	O
republican	O

the	O
most	O

is	O
such	O
a	O

<bos>	O
let	O
me	O
now	O
ask	O
what	O
circumstance	O
there	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
of	O

a	O

it	O
must	O
be	O

that	O

the	O

a	O
fifth	O
circumstance	O
in	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
of	O

restraining	O
them	O
from	O

<bos>	O
this	O
has	O
always	O
been	O

one	O
of	O
the	O

bonds	O
by	O
which	O
human	O
policy	O
can	O
connect	O
the	O
rulers	O

the	O
people	O
together	.
it	O
creates	O
between	O
them	O
that	O
communion	O
of	O
interests	O
and	O
sympathy	O
of	O
sentiments	,
of	O
which	O
few	O
governments	O
have	O
furnished	O
examples	;

without	O
which	O
every	O
government	O
degenerates	O
into	O
tyranny	.
if	O
it	O
be	O
asked	,
what	O
is	O
to	O
restrain	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	O
from	O
making	O
legal	O
discriminations	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
themselves	O
and	O
a	O
particular	O
class	O
of	O
the	O
society	?
i	O
answer	:
the	O
genius	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
system	;
the	O
nature	O
of	O
just	O
and	O
constitutional	O
laws	;
and	O
above	O
all	,
the	O
vigilant	O
and	O
manly	O
spirit	O
which	O
actuates	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
america	,
a	O
spirit	O
which	O
nourishes	O
freedom	,
and	O
in	O
return	O
is	O
nourished	O
by	O
it	.
if	O
this	O
spirit	O
shall	O
ever	O
be	O
so	O
far	O
debased	O
as	O
to	O
tolerate	O
a	O
law	O
not	O
obligatory	O
on	O
the	O
legislature	,
as	O
well	O
as	O
on	O
the	O

the	O
people	O

be	O
prepared	O
to	O
tolerate	O
any	O
thing	O
but	O
liberty	.
such	O
will	O
be	O
the	O
relation	O
between	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	O

their	O

duty	,
gratitude	,
interest	,
ambition	O
itself	,
are	O
the	O

by	O
which	O

be	O
bound	O
to	O
fidelity	O
and	O

with	O
the	O

of	O

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O
possible	O
that	O
these	O
may	O
all	O
be	O
insufficient	O
to	O
control	O
the	O
caprice	O
and	O
wickedness	O
of	O
man	.
but	O
are	O
they	O
not	O
all	O
that	O
government	O
will	O
admit	,
and	O
that	O

prudence	O
can	O

are	O
they	O

which	O

provides	O
for	O
the	O
liberty	O

of	O

are	O
they	O

the	O

means	O
on	O
which	O
every	O
state	O
government	O
in	O
the	O
union	O
relies	O
for	O
the	O
attainment	O
of	O
these	O
important	O
ends	?
what	O
then	O
are	O
we	O
to	O
understand	O
by	O
the	O
objection	O
which	O
this	O
paper	O
has	O
combated	?
what	O
are	O
we	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
the	O
men	O
who	O
profess	O
the	O
most	O
flaming	O
zeal	O
for	O
republican	O
government	,
yet	O
boldly	O
impeach	O
the	O
fundamental	O
principle	O
of	O
it	;
who	O
pretend	O
to	O
be	O
champions	O
for	O
the	O
right	O
and	O
the	O
capacity	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
to	O
choose	O
their	O
own	O
rulers	,
yet	O
maintain	O
that	O
they	O
will	O
prefer	O
those	O
only	O
who	O
will	O
immediately	O
and	O
infallibly	O
betray	O
the	O
trust	O
committed	O
to	O
them	?
were	O
the	O
objection	O
to	O
be	O
read	O
by	O
one	O
who	O
had	O
not	O
seen	O
the	O
mode	O
prescribed	O
by	O
the	O
constitution	O
for	O
the	O
choice	O
of	O
representatives	,
he	O
could	O
suppose	O
nothing	O
less	O
than	O
that	O
some	O
unreasonable	O
qualification	O
of	O
property	O
was	O
annexed	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
of	O
suffrage	;
or	O
that	O
the	O
right	O
of	O
eligibility	O
was	O
limited	O
to	O
persons	O
of	O
particular	O
families	O
or	O
fortunes	;
or	O
at	O
least	O
that	O
the	O
mode	O
prescribed	O
by	O
the	O
state	O
constitutions	O
was	O
in	O
some	O
respect	O
or	O
other	,
very	O
grossly	O
departed	O
from	.
we	O
have	O
seen	O
how	O
far	O
such	O
a	O
supposition	O
would	O
err	,
as	O
to	O
the	O
two	O
first	O
points	.
nor	O
would	O
it	,
in	O
fact	,
be	O
less	O
erroneous	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
last	.

<bos>	O
the	O
only	O
difference	O
discoverable	O
between	O
the	O
two	O
cases	O
is	,
that	O
each	O
representative	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	O
will	O
be	O
elected	O
by	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
thousand	O
citizens	;
whilst	O
in	O
the	O
individual	O
states	,
the	O
election	O
of	O
a	O
representative	O
is	O
left	O
to	O
about	O
as	O
many	O
hundreds	.
will	O
it	O
be	O
pretended	O
that	O
this	O
difference	O
is	O
sufficient	O
to	O
justify	O
an	O
attachment	O
to	O
the	O
state	O
governments	,
and	O
an	O
abhorrence	O
to	O
the	O
federal	O
government	?
if	O
this	O
be	O
the	O
point	O
on	O
which	O
the	O
objection	O
turns	,
it	O
deserves	O
to	O
be	O
examined	.
is	O
it	O
supported	O
by	O
reason	?
this	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
said	,
without	O
maintaining	O
that	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
thousand	O
citizens	O
are	O
less	O
capable	O
of	O
choosing	O
a	O
fit	O
representative	,
or	O
more	O
liable	O
to	O
be	O
corrupted	O
by	O
an	O
unfit	O
one	,
than	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
hundred	.
reason	,
on	O
the	O
contrary	,
assures	O
us	,
that	O
as	O
in	O
so	O
great	O
a	O
number	O
a	O
fit	O
representative	O
would	O
be	O
most	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
found	,
so	O
the	O
choice	O
would	O
be	O
less	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
diverted	O
from	O
him	O
by	O
the	O
intrigues	O
of	O
the	O
ambitious	O
or	O
the	O
ambitious	O
or	O
the	O
bribes	O
of	O
the	O
rich	.
is	O
the	O
consequence	O
from	O
this	O
doctrine	O
admissible	?
if	O
we	O
say	O
that	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
hundred	O
citizens	O
are	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
can	O
jointly	O
exercise	O
their	O
right	O
of	O
suffrage	,
must	O
we	O
not	O
deprive	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
immediate	O

of	O
their	O
public	O

in	O
every	O

the	O

of	O

does	O
not	O

many	O
of	O

as	O
will	O
amount	O
to	O
one	O
for	O
that	O

of	O

the	O
doctrine	O

by	O
facts	?
it	O
was	O
shown	O
in	O

that	O
the	O
real	O

calculating	O
on	O
the	O

of	O

it	O
makes	O
no	O

that	O
in	O
these	O
senatorial	O
districts	O
and	O
counties	O
a	O
number	O
of	O

are	O
voted	O

by	O
each	O

at	O

at	O
the	O

supposed	O
to	O

between	O
fifty	O

sixty	O

it	O
will	O
therefore	O
form	O
nearly	O
two	O
districts	O

the	O

these	O

the	O
most	O

of	O
the	O

which	O
has	O

there	O

a	O
stronger	O
complexion	O
than	O
any	O
which	O

one	O
branch	O
of	O

so	O
constituted	O
that	O
each	O
member	O

is	O
elected	O
by	O
the	O

so	O
is	O
the	O

of	O

of	O
this	O

man	O
to	O
decide	O
whether	O
the	O
result	O
of	O
any	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
experiments	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
countenance	O
a	O
suspicion	,
that	O
a	O
diffusive	O
mode	O
of	O

representatives	O

tends	O
to	O
elevate	O

<bos>	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
new	O
york	:

<bos>	O
having	O
examined	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	,
and	O
answered	O
such	O
of	O
the	O
objections	O
against	O
it	O
as	O
seemed	O
to	O
merit	O
notice	,
i	O
enter	O
next	O
on	O
the	O
examination	O
of	O
the	O
senate	.

<bos>	O
the	O
heads	O
into	O
which	O
this	O
member	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
may	O
be	O
considered	O
are	:

<bos>	O
the	O
qualifications	O
proposed	O
for	O
senators	,
as	O
distinguished	O
from	O
those	O
of	O
representatives	,
consist	O
in	O
a	O
more	O
advanced	O
age	O
and	O
a	O
longer	O
period	O
of	O
citizenship	.
a	O
senator	O
must	O
be	O
thirty	O
years	O
of	O
age	O
at	O
least	;
as	O
a	O
representative	O
must	O
be	O
twenty-five	.
and	O
the	O
former	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
citizen	O
nine	O
years	;
as	O
seven	O
years	O
are	O
required	O
for	O
the	O
latter	.
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
these	O
distinctions	O
is	O
explained	O
by	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
senatorial	O
trust	,
which	,
requiring	O
greater	O
extent	O
of	O
information	O
and	O
tability	O
of	O
character	,
requires	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
that	O
the	O
senator	O
should	O
have	O
reached	O
a	O
period	O
of	O
life	O
most	O
likely	O
to	O
supply	O
these	O
advantages	;
and	O
which	,
participating	O
immediately	O
in	O
transactions	O
with	O
foreign	O
nations	,
ought	O
to	O
be	O
exercised	O
by	O
none	O
who	O
are	O
not	O
thoroughly	O
weaned	O
from	O
the	O
prepossessions	O
and	O
habits	O
incident	O
to	O
foreign	O
birth	O
and	O
education	.
the	O
term	O
of	O
nine	O
years	O
appears	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
prudent	O
mediocrity	O
between	O
a	O
total	O
exclusion	O
of	O
adopted	O
citizens	,
whose	O
merits	O
and	O
talents	O
may	O
claim	O
a	O
share	O
in	O
the	O
public	O
confidence	,
and	O
an	O
indiscriminate	O
and	O
hasty	O
admission	O
of	O
them	,
which	O
might	O
create	O
a	O
channel	O
for	O
foreign	O
influence	O
on	O
the	O
national	O
councils	.

<bos>	O
it	O
is	O
equally	O
unnecessary	O
to	O
dilate	O
on	O
the	O
appointment	O
of	O
senators	O
by	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	.
among	O
the	O
various	O
modes	O
which	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
devised	O
for	O
constituting	O
this	O
branch	O
of	O
the	O
government	,
that	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
proposed	O
by	O
the	O
convention	O
is	O
probably	O
the	O
most	O
congenial	O
with	O
the	O
public	O
opinion	.
it	O
is	O
recommended	O
by	O
the	O
double	O
advantage	O
of	O
favoring	O
a	O
select	O
appointment	,
and	O
of	O
giving	O
to	O
the	O
state	O
governments	O
such	O
an	O
agency	O
in	O
the	O
formation	O
of	O
the	O
federal	O
government	O
as	O
must	O
secure	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
former	,
and	O
may	O
form	O
a	O
convenient	O
link	O
between	O
the	O
two	O
systems	.

<bos>	O
the	O
equality	O
of	O
representation	O
in	O
the	O
senate	O
is	O
another	O
point	,
which	,
being	O
evidently	O
the	O
result	O
of	O
compromise	O
between	O
the	O
opposite	O
pretensions	O
of	O
the	O
large	O
and	O
the	O
small	O
states	,
does	O
not	O
call	O
for	O
much	O
discussion	.
if	O
indeed	O
it	O
be	O
right	,
that	O
among	O
a	O
people	O
thoroughly	O
incorporated	O
into	O
one	O
nation	,
every	O
district	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
proportional	O
share	O
in	O
the	O
government	,
and	O
that	O
among	O
independent	O
and	O
sovereign	O
states	,
bound	O
together	O
by	O
a	O
simple	O
league	,
the	O
parties	,
however	O
unequal	O
in	O
size	,
ought	O
to	O
have	O
an	O
equal	O
share	O
in	O
the	O
common	O
councils	,
it	O
does	O
not	O
appear	O
to	O
be	O
without	O
some	O
reason	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
compound	O
republic	,
partaking	O
both	O
of	O
the	O
national	O
and	O
federal	O
character	,
the	O
government	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
founded	O
on	O
a	O
mixture	O
of	O
the	O
principles	O
of	O
proportional	O
and	O
equal	O
representation	.
but	O
it	O
is	O
superfluous	O
to	O
try	,
by	O
the	O
standard	O
of	O
theory	,
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	O
which	O
is	O
allowed	O
on	O
all	O
hands	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
result	,
not	O
of	O
theory	,
but	O
``	O
of	O
a	O
spirit	O
of	O
amity	,
and	O
that	O
mutual	O
deference	O
and	O
concession	O
which	O
the	O
peculiarity	O
of	O
our	O
political	O
situation	O
rendered	O
indispensable	.
''	O
a	O
common	O
government	,
with	O
powers	O
equal	O
to	O
its	O
objects	,
is	O
called	O
for	O
by	O
the	O
voice	,
and	O
still	O
more	O
loudly	O
by	O
the	O
political	O
situation	,
of	O
america	.
a	O
government	O
founded	O
on	O
principles	O
more	O
consonant	O
to	O
the	O
wishes	O
of	O
the	O
larger	O
states	,
is	O
not	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
obtained	O
from	O
the	O
smaller	O
states	.
the	O
only	O
option	,
then	,
for	O
the	O
former	,
lies	O
between	O
the	O
proposed	O
government	O
and	O
a	O
government	O
still	O
more	O
objectionable	.
under	O
this	O
alternative	,
the	O
advice	O
of	O
prudence	O
must	O
be	O
to	O
embrace	O
the	O
lesser	O
evil	;
and	,
instead	O
of	O
indulging	O
a	O
fruitless	O
anticipation	O
of	O
the	O
possible	O
mischiefs	O
which	O
may	O
ensue	,
to	O
contemplate	O
rather	O
the	O
advantageous	O
consequences	O
which	O
may	O
qualify	O
the	O
sacrifice	.

<bos>	O
in	O
this	O
spirit	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
remarked	,
that	O
the	O
equal	O
vote	O
allowed	O
to	O
each	O
state	O
is	O
at	O
once	O
a	O
constitutional	O
recognition	O
of	O
the	O
portion	O
of	O
sovereignty	O
remaining	O
in	O
the	O
individual	O
states	,
and	O
an	O
instrument	O
for	O
preserving	O
that	O
residuary	O
sovereignty	.
so	O
far	O
the	O
equality	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
no	O
less	O
acceptable	O
to	O
the	O
large	O
than	O
to	O
the	O
small	O
states	;
since	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
less	O
solicitous	O
to	O
guard	,
by	O
every	O
possible	O
expedient	,
against	O
an	O
improper	O
consolidation	O
of	O
the	O
states	O
into	O
one	O
simple	O
republic	.

<bos>	O
another	O
advantage	O
accruing	O
from	O
this	O
ingredient	O
in	O
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
the	O
senate	O
is	,
the	O
additional	O
impediment	O
it	O
must	O
prove	O
against	O
improper	O
acts	O
of	O
legislation	.
no	O
law	O
or	O
resolution	O
can	O
now	O
be	O
passed	O
without	O
the	O
concurrence	,
first	,
of	O
a	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
and	O
then	,
of	O
a	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
states	.
it	O
must	O
be	O
acknowledged	O
that	O
this	O
complicated	O
check	O
on	O
legislation	O
may	O
in	O
some	O
instances	O
be	O
injurious	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
beneficial	;
and	O
that	O
the	O
peculiar	O
defense	O
which	O
it	O
involves	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
the	O
smaller	O
states	,
would	O
be	O
more	O
rational	,
if	O
any	O
interests	O
common	O
to	O
them	,
and	O
distinct	O
from	O
those	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
states	,
would	O
otherwise	O
be	O
exposed	O
to	O
peculiar	O
danger	.
but	O
as	O
the	O
larger	O
states	O
will	O
always	O
be	O
able	,
by	O
their	O
power	O
over	O
the	O
supplies	,
to	O
defeat	O
unreasonable	O
exertions	O
of	O
this	O
prerogative	O
of	O
the	O
lesser	O
states	,
and	O
as	O
the	O
faculty	O
and	O
excess	O
of	O
law-making	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
diseases	O
to	O
which	O
our	O
governments	O
are	O
most	O
liable	,
it	O
is	O
not	O
impossible	O
that	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	O
may	O
be	O
more	O
convenient	O
in	O
practice	O
than	O
it	O
appears	O
to	O
many	O
in	O
contemplation	.

<bos>	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
senators	,
and	O
the	O
duration	O
of	O
their	O
appointment	,
come	O
next	O
to	O
be	O
considered	.
in	O
order	O
to	O
form	O
an	O
accurate	O
judgment	O
on	O
both	O
of	O
these	O
points	,
it	O
will	O
be	O
proper	O
to	O
inquire	O
into	O
the	O
purposes	O
which	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
answered	O
by	O
a	O
senate	;
and	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
ascertain	O
these	,
it	O
will	O
be	O
necessary	O
to	O
review	O
the	O
inconveniences	O
which	O
a	O
republic	O
must	O
suffer	O
from	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
such	O
an	O
institution	.

<bos>	O
first	.
it	O
is	O
a	O
misfortune	O
incident	O
to	O
republican	O
government	,
though	O
in	O
a	O
less	O
degree	O
than	O
to	O
other	O
governments	,
that	O
those	O
who	O
administer	O
it	O
may	O
forget	O
their	O
obligations	O
to	O
their	O
constituents	,
and	O
prove	O
unfaithful	O
to	O
their	O
important	O
trust	.
in	O
this	O
point	O
of	O
view	,
a	O
senate	,
as	O
a	O
second	O
branch	O
of	O
the	O
legislative	O
assembly	,
distinct	O
from	,
and	O
dividing	O
the	O
power	O
with	,
a	O
first	,
must	O
be	O
in	O
all	O
cases	O
a	O
salutary	O
check	O
on	O
the	O
government	.
it	O
doubles	O
the	O
security	O
to	O
the	O
people	,
by	O
requiring	O
the	O
concurrence	O
of	O
two	O
distinct	O
bodies	O
in	O
schemes	O
of	O
usurpation	O
or	O
perfidy	,
where	O
the	O
ambition	O
or	O
corruption	O
of	O
one	O
would	O
otherwise	O
be	O
sufficient	.
this	O
is	O
a	O
precaution	O
founded	O
on	O
such	O
clear	O
principles	,
and	O
now	O
so	O
well	O
understood	O
in	O
the	O
united	O
states	,
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
than	O
superfluous	O
to	O
enlarge	O
on	O
it	.
i	O
will	O
barely	O
remark	,
that	O
as	O
the	O
improbability	O
of	O
sinister	O
combinations	O
will	O
be	O
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
the	O
dissimilarity	O
in	O
the	O
genius	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
bodies	,
it	O
must	O
be	O
politic	O
to	O
distinguish	O
them	O
from	O
each	O
other	O
by	O
every	O
circumstance	O
which	O
will	O
consist	O
with	O
a	O
due	O
harmony	O
in	O
all	O
proper	O
measures	,
and	O
with	O
the	O
genuine	O
principles	O
of	O
republican	O
government	.

<bos>	O
secondly	.
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
a	O
senate	O
is	O
not	O
less	O
indicated	O
by	O
the	O
propensity	O
of	O
all	O
single	O
and	O
numerous	O
assemblies	O
to	O
yield	O
to	O
the	O
impulse	O
of	O
sudden	O
and	O
violent	O
passions	,
and	O
to	O
be	O
seduced	O
by	O
factious	O
leaders	O
into	O
intemperate	O
and	O
pernicious	O
resolutions	.
examples	O
on	O
this	O
subject	O
might	O
be	O
cited	O
without	O
number	;
and	O
from	O
proceedings	O

the	O
united	O

as	O
well	O
as	O
from	O
the	O
history	O
of	O

a	O
position	O
that	O
will	O

not	O
be	O
proved	.
all	O
that	O
need	O
be	O
remarked	O
is	,
that	O
a	O
body	O
which	O
is	O
to	O
correct	O
this	O
infirmity	O

itself	O
to	O
be	O

<bos>	O
thirdly	.
another	O
defect	O
to	O
be	O
supplied	O
by	O
a	O
senate	O
lies	O
in	O
a	O
want	O
of	O
due	O
acquaintance	O
with	O
the	O
objects	O
and	O
principles	O
of	O
legislation	.
it	O
is	O
not	O
possible	O
that	O
an	O
assembly	O
of	O
men	O
called	O
for	O
the	O
most	O
part	O
from	O
pursuits	O
of	O
a	O
private	O
nature	,
continued	O
in	O
appointment	O
for	O
a	O
short	O
time	,
and	O
led	O
by	O
no	O
permanent	O
motive	O
to	O
devote	O
the	O
intervals	O
of	O
public	O
occupation	O
to	O
a	O
study	O
of	O
the	O
laws	,
the	O
affairs	,
and	O
the	O
comprehensive	O
interests	O
of	O
their	O
country	,
should	,
if	O
left	O
wholly	O
to	O
themselves	,
escape	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
important	O
errors	O
in	O
the	O
exercise	O
of	O
their	O
legislative	O
trust	.
it	O
may	O
be	O
affirmed	,
on	O
the	O
best	O
grounds	,
that	O
no	O
small	O
share	O
of	O
the	O
present	O
embarrassments	O
of	O
america	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
charged	O
on	O
the	O
blunders	O
of	O
our	O
governments	;
and	O
that	O
these	O
have	O
proceeded	O
from	O
the	O
heads	O
rather	O
than	O
the	O
hearts	O
of	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
authors	O
of	O
them	.
what	O
indeed	O
are	O
all	O
the	O
repealing	,
explaining	,
and	O
amending	O
laws	,
which	O
fill	O
and	O
disgrace	O
our	O
voluminous	O
codes	,
but	O
so	O
many	O
monuments	O
of	O
deficient	O
wisdom	;
so	O
many	O
impeachments	O
exhibited	O
by	O
each	O
succeeding	O
against	O
each	O
preceding	O
session	;
so	O
many	O
admonitions	O
to	O
the	O
people	,
of	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
those	O
aids	O
which	O
may	O
be	O
expected	O
from	O
a	O
well-constituted	O
senate	?

<bos>	O
a	O
good	O
government	O
implies	O
two	O
things	:
first	,
fidelity	O
to	O
the	O
object	O
of	O
government	,
which	O
is	O
the	O
happiness	O
of	O
the	O
people	;
secondly	,
a	O
knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
means	O
by	O
which	O
that	O
object	O
can	O
be	O
best	O
attained	.
some	O
governments	O
are	O
deficient	O
in	O
both	O
these	O
qualities	;
most	O
governments	O
are	O
deficient	O
in	O
the	O
first	.
i	O
scruple	O
not	O
to	O
assert	,
that	O
in	O
american	O
governments	O
too	O
little	O
attention	O
has	O
been	O
paid	O
to	O
the	O
last	.
the	O
federal	O
constitution	O
avoids	O
this	O
error	;
and	O
what	O
merits	O
particular	O
notice	,
it	O
provides	O
for	O
the	O
last	O
in	O
a	O
mode	O
which	O
increases	O
the	O
security	O
for	O
the	O
first	.

<bos>	O
fourthly	.
the	O
mutability	O
in	O
the	O
public	O
councils	O
arising	O
from	O
a	O
rapid	O
succession	O
of	O
new	O
members	,
however	O
qualified	O
they	O
may	O
be	,
points	O
out	,
in	O
the	O
strongest	O
manner	,
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
some	O
stable	O
institution	O
in	O
the	O
government	.
every	O
new	O
election	O
in	O
the	O
states	O
is	O
found	O
to	O
change	O
one	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
representatives	.
from	O
this	O
change	O
of	O
men	O
must	O
proceed	O
a	O
change	O
of	O
opinions	;
and	O
from	O
a	O
change	O
of	O
opinions	,
a	O
change	O
of	O
measures	.
but	O
a	O
continual	O
change	O
even	O
of	O
good	O
measures	O
is	O
inconsistent	O
with	O
every	O
rule	O
of	O
prudence	O
and	O
every	O
prospect	O
of	O
success	.
the	O
remark	O
is	O
verified	O
in	O
private	O
life	,
and	O
becomes	O
more	O
just	,
as	O
well	O
as	O
more	O
important	,
in	O
national	O
transactions	.

<bos>	O
to	O

the	O

of	O
a	O

from	O
the	O

policy	O
of	O

but	O
the	O
best	O
instruction	O
on	O
this	O
subject	O
is	O
unhappily	O
conveyed	O
to	O
america	O
by	O
the	O
example	O
of	O
her	O

situation	.
she	O
finds	O
that	O
she	O
is	O
held	O
in	O
no	O
respect	O
by	O
her	O
friends	;
that	O
she	O
is	O
the	O
derision	O
of	O

that	O

an	O

in	O

it	O
will	O
be	O
of	O
little	O
avail	O
to	O
the	O
people	,
that	O
the	O
laws	O
are	O
made	O
by	O
men	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
choice	,
if	O
the	O

that	O

that	O

what	O

a	O

how	O

which	O

a	O
state	O
of	O

in	O
which	O
it	O

in	O
another	O
point	O

great	O

from	O
an	O
unstable	O
government	.
the	O
want	O
of	O
confidence	O
in	O
the	O
public	O

damps	O
every	O
useful	O

the	O
success	O
and	O
profit	O
of	O
which	O
may	O
depend	O
on	O
a	O
continuance	O
of	O

what	O

will	O
hazard	O
his	O
fortunes	O
in	O
any	O
new	O
branch	O
of	O
commerce	O
when	O
he	O

but	O
that	O
his	O
plans	O
may	O
be	O
rendered	O

before	O
they	O
can	O

what	O

himself	O
out	O
for	O
the	O
encouragement	O
given	O
to	O

labors	O

will	O

in	O
a	O
word	,
no	O
great	O
improvement	O

which	O

of	O
a	O

system	O
of	O
national	O
policy	.

<bos>	O
but	O
the	O
most	O
deplorable	O
effect	O
of	O
all	O
is	O
that	O
diminution	O
of	O
attachment	O
and	O
reverence	O
which	O
steals	O
into	O
the	O
hearts	O
of	O
the	O

no	O
government	,
any	O

<bos>	O
a	O
fifth	O
desideratum	,
illustrating	O
the	O
utility	O
of	O
a	O
senate	,
is	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
a	O
due	O
sense	O
of	O
national	O
character	.
without	O
a	O
select	O
and	O
stable	O
member	O
of	O
the	O
government	,
the	O
esteem	O
of	O
foreign	O
powers	O
will	O
not	O
only	O
be	O
forfeited	O
by	O
an	O
unenlightened	O
and	O
variable	O
policy	,
proceeding	O
from	O
the	O
causes	O
already	O
mentioned	,
but	O
the	O
national	O
councils	O
will	O
not	O
possess	O
that	O
sensibility	O
to	O
the	O
opinion	O
of	O
the	O
world	,
which	O
is	O
perhaps	O
not	O
less	O
necessary	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
merit	,
than	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
obtain	,
its	O
respect	O
and	O
confidence	.

<bos>	O
an	O
attention	O
to	O
the	O
judgment	O
of	O
other	O
nations	O
is	O
important	O
to	O
every	O
government	O
for	O
two	O
reasons	:
the	O
one	O
is	,
that	,
independently	O
of	O
the	O
merits	O
of	O
any	O
particular	O
plan	O
or	O
measure	,
it	O
is	O
desirable	,
on	O
various	O
accounts	,
that	O
it	O
should	O
appear	O
to	O
other	O
nations	O
as	O
the	O
offspring	O
of	O
a	O
wise	O
and	O
honorable	O
policy	;
the	O
second	O
is	,
that	O
in	O
doubtful	O
cases	,
particularly	O
where	O
the	O
national	O
councils	O
may	O
be	O
warped	O
by	O
some	O
strong	O
passion	O
or	O
momentary	O
interest	,
the	O
presumed	O
or	O
known	O
opinion	O

what	O
has	O
not	O
america	O
lost	O
by	O
her	O
want	O
of	O

with	O

how	O

the	O
justice	O

in	O
every	O
instance	,
been	O
previously	O
tried	O
by	O
the	O
light	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
would	O
probably	O
appear	O
to	O
the	O
unbiased	O
part	O
of	O
mankind	?

<bos>	O
yet	O
however	O
requisite	O
a	O
sense	O
of	O
national	O
character	O
may	O
be	,
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
it	O
can	O
never	O
be	O
sufficiently	O
possessed	O
by	O
a	O
numerous	O
and	O
changeable	O
body	.
it	O
can	O
only	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
a	O
number	O
so	O
small	O
that	O
a	O
sensible	O
degree	O
of	O
the	O
praise	O
and	O
blame	O
of	O
public	O
measures	O
may	O
be	O
the	O
portion	O
of	O
each	O
individual	;
or	O
in	O
an	O
assembly	O
so	O
durably	O
invested	O
with	O
public	O
trust	,
that	O
the	O
pride	O

of	O

may	O
be	O
sensibly	O
incorporated	O
with	O
the	O
reputation	O

prosperity	O
of	O
the	O

the	O
half-yearly	O
representatives	O
of	O
rhode	O
island	O
would	O
probably	O
have	O
been	O
little	O
affected	O
in	O
their	O
deliberations	O
on	O
the	O
iniquitous	O
measures	O
of	O
that	O
state	,
by	O
arguments	O
drawn	O
from	O
the	O
light	O
in	O
which	O
such	O
measures	O
would	O
be	O
viewed	O
by	O
foreign	O
nations	,
or	O
even	O
by	O
the	O
sister	O
states	;
whilst	O
it	O
can	O
scarcely	O
be	O
doubted	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
concurrence	O
of	O
a	O
select	O
and	O
stable	O
body	O
had	O
been	O
necessary	,
a	O
regard	O
to	O
national	O
character	O
alone	O
would	O
have	O
prevented	O
the	O
calamities	O
under	O
which	O
that	O
misguided	O
people	O
is	O
now	O
laboring	.

i	O
add	,
as	O
a	O
sixth	O
defect	O
the	O
want	,
in	O
some	O
important	O
cases	,
of	O
a	O
due	O
responsibility	O
in	O
the	O
government	O
to	O
the	O
people	,
arising	O
from	O
that	O
frequency	O
of	O
elections	O
which	O
in	O
other	O
cases	O
produces	O
this	O
responsibility	.
this	O
remark	O
will	,
perhaps	,
appear	O
not	O
only	O
new	,
but	O
paradoxical	.
it	O
must	O
nevertheless	O
be	O
acknowledged	,
when	O
explained	,
to	O
be	O
as	O
undeniable	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
important	.

<bos>	O
responsibility	,
in	O
order	O
to	O
be	O
reasonable	,
must	O
be	O
limited	O
to	O
objects	O
within	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
the	O
responsible	O
party	,
and	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
be	O
effectual	,
must	O
relate	O
to	O
operations	O
of	O
that	O
power	,
of	O
which	O
a	O
ready	O
and	O
proper	O
judgment	O
can	O
be	O
formed	O
by	O

the	O
objects	O
of	O

may	O
be	O
divided	O
into	O
two	O
general	O
classes	:
the	O
one	O
depending	O
on	O
measures	O
which	O
have	O
singly	O
an	O
immediate	O
and	O
sensible	O
operation	;
the	O
other	O
depending	O
on	O
a	O
succession	O
of	O
well-chosen	O
and	O
well-connected	O
measures	,
which	O
have	O
a	O
gradual	O
and	O
perhaps	O
unobserved	O
operation	.

of	O
the	O

description	O
to	O
the	O
collective	O
and	O
permanent	O
welfare	O
of	O
every	O
country	,
needs	O
no	O
explanation	.
and	O
yet	O
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
an	O
assembly	O
elected	O
for	O
so	O
short	O
a	O
term	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
unable	O
to	O
provide	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
links	O
in	O
a	O
chain	O
of	O
measures	,
on	O
which	O
the	O
general	O
welfare	O
may	O
essentially	O
depend	,
ought	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
answerable	O
for	O
the	O
final	O
result	,
any	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
steward	O
or	O
tenant	,
engaged	O
for	O
one	O
year	,
could	O
be	O
justly	O
made	O
to	O
answer	O
for	O
places	O
or	O
improvements	O
which	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
accomplished	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
half	O
a	O
dozen	O
years	.
nor	O
is	O
it	O
possible	O
for	O
the	O
people	O
to	O
estimate	O
the	O
share	O
of	O
influence	O
which	O
their	O
annual	O
assemblies	O
may	O
respectively	O
have	O
on	O
events	O
resulting	O
from	O
the	O
mixed	O
transactions	O
of	O
several	O
years	.
it	O
is	O
sufficiently	O
difficult	O
to	O
preserve	O
a	O
personal	O
responsibility	O
in	O
the	O
members	O
of	O
a	O
numerous	O
body	,
for	O
such	O
acts	O
of	O
the	O
body	O
as	O
have	O
an	O
immediate	,
detached	,
and	O
palpable	O
operation	O
on	O
its	O
constituents	.

<bos>	O
the	O
proper	O
remedy	O
for	O
this	O
defect	O
must	O
be	O
an	O
additional	O
body	O
in	O
the	O
legislative	O
department	,
which	,
having	O
sufficient	O
permanency	O
to	O
provide	O
for	O
such	O
objects	O
as	O
require	O
a	O
continued	O
attention	,
and	O
a	O
train	O
of	O
measures	,
may	O
be	O
justly	O
and	O
effectually	O
answerable	O
for	O
the	O
attainment	O
of	O
those	O
objects	.

<bos>	O
thus	O
far	O
i	O
have	O
considered	O
the	O
circumstances	O
which	O
point	O
out	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
a	O
well-constructed	O
senate	O
only	O
as	O
they	O
relate	O
to	O
the	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
people	.
to	O
a	O
people	O
as	O
little	O
blinded	O
by	O
prejudice	O
or	O
corrupted	O
by	O
flattery	O
as	O
those	O
whom	O
i	O
address	,
i	O
shall	O
not	O
scruple	O
to	O
add	,
that	O
such	O
an	O
institution	O
may	O
be	O
sometimes	O
necessary	O
as	O
a	O
defense	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
against	O
their	O
own	O
temporary	O
errors	O
and	O
delusions	.
as	O
the	O
cool	O
and	O
deliberate	O
sense	O
of	O
the	O
community	O
ought	,
in	O
all	O
governments	,
and	O
actually	O
will	,
in	O
all	O
free	O
governments	,
ultimately	O
prevail	O
over	O
the	O
views	O
of	O
its	O
rulers	;
so	O
there	O
are	O
particular	O
moments	O
in	O
public	O
affairs	O
when	O
the	O
people	,
stimulated	O
by	O
some	O
irregular	O
passion	,
or	O
some	O
illicit	O
advantage	,
or	O
misled	O
by	O
the	O
artful	O
misrepresentations	O
of	O
interested	O
men	,
may	O
call	O
for	O
measures	O
which	O
they	O
themselves	O
will	O
afterwards	O
be	O
the	O
most	O
ready	O
to	O
lament	O
and	O
condemn	.
in	O
these	O
critical	O
moments	,
how	O
salutary	O
will	O
be	O
the	O
interference	O
of	O
some	O
temperate	O
and	O
respectable	O
body	O
of	O
citizens	,
in	O
order	O
to	O
check	O
the	O
misguided	O
career	,
and	O
to	O
suspend	O
the	O
blow	O
meditated	O
by	O
the	O
people	O
against	O
themselves	,
until	O
reason	,
justice	,
and	O
truth	O
can	O
regain	O
their	O
authority	O
over	O
the	O
public	O
mind	?
what	O
bitter	O
anguish	O
would	O
not	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
athens	O
have	O
often	O
escaped	O
if	O
their	O
government	O
had	O
contained	O
so	O
provident	O
a	O
safeguard	O
against	O
the	O
tyranny	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
passions	?
popular	O
liberty	O
might	O
then	O
have	O
escaped	O
the	O
indelible	O
reproach	O
of	O
decreeing	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
citizens	O
the	O
hemlock	O
on	O
one	O
day	O
and	O
statues	O
on	O
the	O
next	.

<bos>	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
suggested	,
that	O
a	O
people	O
spread	O
over	O
an	O
extensive	O
region	O
can	O
not	,
like	O
the	O
crowded	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
district	,
be	O
subject	O
to	O
the	O
infection	O
of	O
violent	O
passions	,
or	O
to	O
the	O
danger	O
of	O
combining	O
in	O
pursuit	O
of	O
unjust	O
measures	.
i	O
am	O
far	O
from	O
denying	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
distinction	O
of	O
peculiar	O
importance	.
i	O
have	,
on	O
the	O
contrary	,
endeavored	O
in	O
a	O
former	O
paper	O
to	O
show	,
that	O
it	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
principal	O
recommendations	O
of	O
a	O
confederated	O
republic	.
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	,
this	O
advantage	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
superseding	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
auxiliary	O
precautions	.
it	O
may	O
even	O
be	O
remarked	,
that	O
the	O
same	O
extended	O
situation	,
which	O
will	O
exempt	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
america	O
from	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
dangers	O
incident	O
to	O
lesser	O
republics	,
will	O
expose	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
inconveniency	O
of	O
remaining	O
for	O
a	O
longer	O
time	O
under	O
the	O
influence	O
of	O
those	O
misrepresentations	O
which	O
the	O
combined	O
industry	O
of	O
interested	O
men	O
may	O
succeed	O
in	O
distributing	O
among	O
them	.

<bos>	O
it	O
adds	O
no	O
small	O
weight	O
to	O
all	O
these	O
considerations	,
to	O
recollect	O
that	O
history	O
informs	O
us	O
of	O
no	O
long-lived	O
republic	O
which	O
had	O
not	O
a	O
senate	.
sparta	,
rome	,
and	O
carthage	O
are	,
in	O
fact	,
the	O
only	O
states	O
to	O
whom	O
that	O
character	O
can	O
be	O
applied	.
in	O
each	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
first	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
senate	O
for	O
life	.
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
the	O
senate	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
is	O
less	O
known	.
circumstantial	O
evidence	O
makes	O
it	O
probable	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
different	O
in	O
this	O
particular	O
from	O
the	O
two	O
others	.
it	O
is	O
at	O
least	O
certain	,
that	O
it	O
had	O
some	O
quality	O
or	O
other	O
which	O
rendered	O
it	O
an	O
anchor	O
against	O
popular	O
fluctuations	;
and	O
that	O
a	O
smaller	O
council	,
drawn	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
senate	,
was	O
appointed	O
not	O
only	O
for	O
life	,
but	O
filled	O
up	O
vacancies	O
itself	.
these	O
examples	,
though	O
as	O
unfit	O
for	O
the	O
imitation	,
as	O
they	O
are	O
repugnant	O
to	O
the	O
genius	,
of	O
america	,
are	,
notwithstanding	,
when	O
compared	O
with	O
the	O
fugitive	O
and	O
turbulent	O
existence	O
of	O
other	O
ancient	O
republics	,
very	O
instructive	O
proofs	O
of	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
some	O
institution	O
that	O
will	O
blend	O
stability	O
with	O
liberty	.
i	O
am	O
not	O
unaware	O
of	O
the	O
circumstances	O
which	O
distinguish	O
the	O
american	O
from	O
other	O
popular	O
governments	,
as	O
well	O
ancient	O
as	O
modern	;
and	O
which	O
render	O
extreme	O
circumspection	O
necessary	,
in	O
reasoning	O
from	O
the	O
one	O
case	O
to	O
the	O
other	.
but	O
after	O
allowing	O
due	O
weight	O
to	O
this	O
consideration	,
it	O
may	O
still	O
be	O
maintained	,
that	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
points	O
of	O
similitude	O
which	O
render	O
these	O
examples	O
not	O
unworthy	O
of	O
our	O
attention	.
many	O
of	O
the	O
defects	,
as	O
we	O
have	O
seen	,
which	O
can	O
only	O
be	O
supplied	O
by	O
a	O
senatorial	O
institution	,
are	O
common	O
to	O
a	O
numerous	O
assembly	O
frequently	O
elected	O
by	O
the	O
people	,
and	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
themselves	.
there	O
are	O
others	O
peculiar	O
to	O
the	O
former	,
which	O
require	O
the	O
control	O
of	O
such	O
an	O
institution	.
the	O
people	O
can	O
never	O
wilfully	O
betray	O
their	O
own	O
interests	;
but	O
they	O
may	O
possibly	O
be	O
betrayed	O
by	O
the	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
people	;
and	O
the	O
danger	O
will	O
be	O
evidently	O
greater	O
where	O
the	O
whole	O
legislative	O
trust	O
is	O
lodged	O
in	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
one	O
body	O
of	O
men	,
than	O
where	O
the	O
concurrence	O
of	O
separate	O
and	O
dissimilar	O
bodies	O
is	O
required	O
in	O
every	O
public	O
act	.

<bos>	O
the	O
difference	O
most	O
relied	O
on	,
between	O
the	O
american	O
and	O
other	O
republics	,
consists	O
in	O
the	O
principle	O
of	O
representation	;
which	O
is	O
the	O
pivot	O
on	O
which	O
the	O
former	O
move	,
and	O
which	O
is	O
supposed	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
unknown	O
to	O
the	O
latter	,
or	O
at	O
least	O
to	O
the	O
ancient	O
part	O
of	O
them	.
the	O
use	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
made	O
of	O
this	O
difference	,
in	O
reasonings	O
contained	O
in	O
former	O
papers	,
will	O
have	O
shown	O
that	O
i	O
am	O
disposed	O
neither	O
to	O
deny	O
its	O
existence	O
nor	O
to	O
undervalue	O
its	O
importance	.
i	O
feel	O
the	O
less	O
restraint	,
therefore	,
in	O
observing	,
that	O
the	O
position	O
concerning	O
the	O
ignorance	O
of	O
the	O
ancient	O
governments	O
on	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
representation	,
is	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
precisely	O
true	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
commonly	O
given	O
to	O
it	.
without	O
entering	O
into	O
a	O
disquisition	O
which	O
here	O
would	O
be	O
misplaced	,
i	O
will	O
refer	O
to	O
a	O
few	O
known	O
facts	,
in	O
support	O
of	O
what	O
i	O
advance	.

<bos>	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
pure	O
democracies	O
of	O
greece	,
many	O
of	O
the	O
executive	O
functions	O
were	O
performed	,
not	O
by	O
the	O
people	O
themselves	,
but	O
by	O
officers	O
elected	O
by	O
the	O
people	,
and	O
representing	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
their	O
executive	O
capacity	.

<bos>	O
prior	O
to	O
the	O
reform	O
of	O
solon	,
athens	O
was	O
governed	O
by	O
nine	O
archons	,
annually	O
elected	O
by	O
the	O
people	O
at	O
large	.
the	O
degree	O
of	O
power	O
delegated	O
to	O
them	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
left	O
in	O
great	O
obscurity	.
subsequent	O
to	O
that	O
period	,
we	O
find	O
an	O
assembly	,
first	O
of	O
four	,
and	O
afterwards	O
of	O
six	O
hundred	O
members	,
annually	O
elected	O
by	O
the	O
people	;
and	O
partially	O
representing	O
them	O
in	O
their	O
legislative	O
capacity	,
since	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
only	O
associated	O
with	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
function	O
of	O
making	O
laws	,
but	O
had	O
the	O
exclusive	O
right	O
of	O
originating	O
legislative	O
propositions	O
to	O
the	O
people	.
the	O
senate	O
of	O
carthage	,
also	,
whatever	O
might	O
be	O
its	O
power	,
or	O
the	O
duration	O
of	O
its	O
appointment	,
appears	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
elective	O
by	O
the	O
suffrages	O
of	O
the	O
people	.
similar	O
instances	O
might	O
be	O
traced	O
in	O
most	,
if	O
not	O
all	O
the	O
popular	O
governments	O
of	O
antiquity	.

<bos>	O
lastly	,
in	O
sparta	O
we	O
meet	O
with	O
the	O
ephori	,
and	O
in	O
rome	O
with	O
the	O
tribunes	;
two	O
bodies	,
small	O
indeed	O
in	O
numbers	,
but	O
annually	O
elected	O
by	O
the	O
whole	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
and	O
considered	O
as	O
the	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
almost	O
in	O
their	O
plenipotentiary	O
capacity	.
the	O
cosmi	O
of	O
crete	O
were	O
also	O
annually	O
elected	O
by	O
the	O
people	,
and	O
have	O
been	O
considered	O
by	O
some	O
authors	O
as	O
an	O
institution	O
analogous	O
to	O
those	O
of	O
sparta	O
and	O
rome	,
with	O
this	O
difference	O
only	,
that	O
in	O
the	O
election	O
of	O
that	O
representative	O
body	O
the	O
right	O
of	O
suffrage	O
was	O
communicated	O
to	O
a	O
part	O
only	O
of	O
the	O
people	.

<bos>	O
from	O
these	O
facts	,
to	O
which	O
many	O
others	O
might	O
be	O
added	,
it	O
is	O
clear	O
that	O
the	O
principle	O
of	O
representation	O
was	O
neither	O
unknown	O
to	O
the	O
ancients	O
nor	O
wholly	O
overlooked	O
in	O
their	O
political	O
constitutions	.
the	O
true	O
distinction	O
between	O
these	O
and	O
the	O
american	O
governments	,
lies	O
in	O
the	O
total	O
exclusion	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
in	O
their	O
collective	O
capacity	,
from	O
any	O
share	O
in	O
the	O
latter	,
and	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
total	O
exclusion	O
of	O
the	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
from	O
the	O
administration	O
of	O
the	O
former	.
the	O
distinction	,
however	,
thus	O
qualified	,
must	O
be	O
admitted	O
to	O
leave	O
a	O
most	O
advantageous	O
superiority	O
in	O
favor	O
of	O
the	O
united	O
states	.
but	O
to	O
insure	O
to	O
this	O
advantage	O
its	O
full	O
effect	,
we	O
must	O
be	O
careful	O
not	O
to	O
separate	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
other	O
advantage	,
of	O
an	O
extensive	O
territory	.
for	O
it	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
believed	,
that	O
any	O
form	O
of	O
representative	O
government	O
could	O
have	O
succeeded	O
within	O
the	O
narrow	O
limits	O
occupied	O
by	O
the	O
democracies	O
of	O
greece	.

<bos>	O
in	O
answer	O
to	O
all	O
these	O
arguments	,
suggested	O
by	O
reason	,
illustrated	O
by	O
examples	,
and	O
enforced	O
by	O
our	O
own	O
experience	,
the	O
jealous	O
adversary	O
of	O
the	O
constitution	O
will	O
probably	O
content	O
himself	O
with	O
repeating	,
that	O
a	O
senate	O
appointed	O
not	O
immediately	O
by	O
the	O
people	,
and	O
for	O
the	O
term	O
of	O
six	O
years	,
must	O
gradually	O
acquire	O
a	O
dangerous	O
pre-eminence	O
in	O
the	O
government	,
and	O
finally	O
transform	O
it	O
into	O
a	O
tyrannical	O
aristocracy	.

<bos>	O
to	O
this	O
general	O
answer	,
the	O
general	O
reply	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
sufficient	,
that	O
liberty	O
may	O
be	O
endangered	O
by	O
the	O
abuses	O
of	O
liberty	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
by	O
the	O
abuses	O
of	O
power	;
that	O
there	O
are	O
numerous	O
instances	O
of	O
the	O
former	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
of	O
the	O
latter	;
and	O
that	O
the	O
former	,
rather	O
than	O
the	O
latter	,
are	O
apparently	O
most	O
to	O
be	O
apprehended	O
by	O
the	O
united	O
states	.
but	O
a	O
more	O
particular	O
reply	O
may	O
be	O
given	.

<bos>	O
before	O
such	O
a	O
revolution	O
can	O
be	O
effected	,
the	O
senate	,
it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
observed	,
must	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
corrupt	O
itself	;
must	O
next	O
corrupt	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	;
must	O
then	O
corrupt	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	;
and	O
must	O
finally	O
corrupt	O
the	O
people	O
at	O
large	.
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
the	O
senate	O
must	O
be	O
first	O
corrupted	O
before	O
it	O
can	O
attempt	O
an	O
establishment	O
of	O
tyranny	.
without	O
corrupting	O
the	O
state	O
legislatures	,
it	O
can	O
not	O
prosecute	O
the	O
attempt	,
because	O
the	O
periodical	O
change	O
of	O
members	O
would	O
otherwise	O
regenerate	O
the	O
whole	O
body	.
without	O
exerting	O
the	O
means	O
of	O
corruption	O
with	O
equal	O
success	O
on	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	,
the	O
opposition	O
of	O
that	O
coequal	O
branch	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
would	O
inevitably	O
defeat	O
the	O
attempt	;
and	O
without	O
corrupting	O
the	O
people	O
themselves	,
a	O
succession	O
of	O
new	O
representatives	O
would	O
speedily	O
restore	O
all	O
things	O
to	O
their	O
pristine	O
order	.
is	O
there	O
any	O
man	O
who	O
can	O
seriously	O
persuade	O
himself	O
that	O
the	O
proposed	O
senate	O
can	,
by	O
any	O
possible	O
means	O
within	O
the	O
compass	O
of	O
human	O
address	,
arrive	O
at	O
the	O
object	O
of	O
a	O
lawless	O
ambition	,
through	O
all	O
these	O
obstructions	?

<bos>	O
if	O
reason	O
condemns	O
the	O
suspicion	,
the	O
same	O
sentence	O
is	O
pronounced	O
by	O
experience	.
the	O
constitution	O
of	O
maryland	O
furnishes	O
the	O
most	O
apposite	O
example	.
the	O
senate	O
of	O
that	O
state	O
is	O
elected	,
as	O
the	O
federal	O
senate	O
will	O
be	,
indirectly	O
by	O
the	O
people	,
and	O
for	O
a	O
term	O
less	O
by	O
one	O
year	O
only	O
than	O
the	O
federal	O
senate	.
it	O
is	O
distinguished	,
also	,
by	O
the	O
remarkable	O
prerogative	O
of	O
filling	O
up	O
its	O
own	O
vacancies	O
within	O
the	O
term	O
of	O
its	O
appointment	,
and	,
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	,
is	O
not	O
under	O
the	O
control	O
of	O
any	O
such	O
rotation	O
as	O
is	O
provided	O
for	O
the	O
federal	O
senate	.
there	O
are	O
some	O
other	O
lesser	O
distinctions	,
which	O
would	O
expose	O
the	O
former	O
to	O
colorable	O
objections	,
that	O
do	O
not	O
lie	O
against	O
the	O
latter	.
if	O
the	O
federal	O
senate	,
therefore	,
really	O
contained	O
the	O
danger	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
so	O
loudly	O
proclaimed	,
some	O
symptoms	O
at	O
least	O
of	O
a	O
like	O
danger	O
ought	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
betrayed	O
by	O
the	O
senate	O
of	O
maryland	,
but	O
no	O
such	O
symptoms	O
have	O
appeared	.
on	O
the	O
contrary	,
the	O
jealousies	O
at	O
first	O
entertained	O
by	O
men	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
description	O
with	O
those	O
who	O
view	O
with	O
terror	O
the	O
correspondent	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
federal	O
constitution	,
have	O
been	O
gradually	O
extinguished	O
by	O
the	O
progress	O
of	O
the	O
experiment	;
and	O
the	O
maryland	O
constitution	O
is	O
daily	O
deriving	,
from	O
the	O
salutary	O
operation	O
of	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
it	,
a	O
reputation	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
will	O
probably	O
not	O
be	O
rivalled	O
by	O
that	O
of	O
any	O
state	O
in	O
the	O
union	.

<bos>	O
but	O
if	O
any	O
thing	O
could	O
silence	O
the	O
jealousies	O
on	O
this	O
subject	,
it	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
british	O
example	.
the	O
senate	O
there	O
instead	O
of	O
being	O
elected	O
for	O
a	O
term	O
of	O
six	O
years	,
and	O
of	O
being	O
unconfined	O
to	O
particular	O
families	O
or	O
fortunes	,
is	O
an	O
hereditary	O
assembly	O
of	O
opulent	O
nobles	.
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	,
instead	O
of	O
being	O
elected	O
for	O
two	O
years	,
and	O
by	O
the	O
whole	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
is	O
elected	O
for	O
seven	O
years	,
and	,
in	O
very	O
great	O
proportion	,
by	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
proportion	O
of	O
the	O
people	.
here	,
unquestionably	,
ought	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
in	O
full	O
display	O
the	O
aristocratic	O
usurpations	O
and	O
tyranny	O
which	O
are	O
at	O
some	O
future	O
period	O
to	O
be	O
exemplified	O
in	O
the	O
united	O
states	.
unfortunately	,
however	,
for	O
the	O
anti-federal	O
argument	,
the	O
british	O
history	O
informs	O
us	O
that	O
this	O
hereditary	O
assembly	O
has	O
not	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
defend	O
itself	O
against	O
the	O
continual	O
encroachments	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	;
and	O
that	O
it	O
no	O
sooner	O
lost	O
the	O
support	O
of	O
the	O
monarch	,
than	O
it	O
was	O
actually	O
crushed	O
by	O
the	O
weight	O
of	O
the	O
popular	O
branch	.

<bos>	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
antiquity	O
can	O
instruct	O
us	O
on	O
this	O
subject	,
its	O
examples	O
support	O
the	O
reasoning	O
which	O
we	O
have	O
employed	.
in	O
sparta	,
the	O
ephori	,
the	O
annual	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
were	O
found	O
an	O
overmatch	O
for	O
the	O
senate	O
for	O
life	,
continually	O
gained	O
on	O
its	O
authority	O
and	O
finally	O
drew	O
all	O
power	O
into	O
their	O
own	O
hands	.
the	O
tribunes	O
of	O
rome	,
who	O
were	O
the	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
prevailed	,
it	O
is	O
well	O
known	,
in	O
almost	O
every	O
contest	O
with	O
the	O
senate	O
for	O
life	,
and	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
gained	O
the	O
most	O
complete	O
triumph	O
over	O
it	.
the	O
fact	O
is	O
the	O
more	O
remarkable	,
as	O
unanimity	O
was	O
required	O
in	O
every	O
act	O
of	O
the	O
tribunes	,
even	O
after	O
their	O
number	O
was	O
augmented	O
to	O
ten	.
it	O
proves	O
the	O
irresistible	O
force	O
possessed	O
by	O
that	O
branch	O
of	O
a	O
free	O
government	,
which	O
has	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
its	O
side	.
to	O
these	O
examples	O
might	O
be	O
added	O
that	O
of	O
carthage	,
whose	O
senate	,
according	O
to	O
the	O
testimony	O
of	O
polybius	,
instead	O
of	O
drawing	O
all	O
power	O
into	O
its	O
vortex	,
had	,
at	O
the	O
commencement	O
of	O
the	O
second	O
punic	O
war	,
lost	O
almost	O
the	O
whole	O
of	O
its	O
original	O
portion	.

<bos>	O
besides	O
the	O
conclusive	O
evidence	O
resulting	O
from	O
this	O
assemblage	O
of	O
facts	,
that	O
the	O
federal	O
senate	O
will	O
never	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
transform	O
itself	,
by	O
gradual	O
usurpations	,
into	O
an	O
independent	O
and	O
aristocratic	O
body	,
we	O
are	O
warranted	O
in	O
believing	,
that	O
if	O
such	O
a	O
revolution	O
should	O
ever	O
happen	O
from	O
causes	O
which	O
the	O
foresight	O
of	O
man	O
can	O
not	O
guard	O
against	,
the	O
house	O
of	O
representatives	,
with	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
their	O
side	,
will	O
at	O
all	O
times	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
bring	O
back	O
the	O
constitution	O
to	O
its	O
primitive	O
form	O
and	O
principles	.
against	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
the	O
immediate	O
representatives	O
of	O
the	O
people	,
nothing	O
will	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
maintain	O
even	O
the	O
constitutional	O
authority	O
of	O
the	O
senate	,
but	O
such	O
a	O
display	O
of	O
enlightened	O
policy	,
and	O
attachment	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
good	,
as	O
will	O
divide	O
with	O
that	O
branch	O
of	O
the	O
legislature	O
the	O
affections	O
and	O
support	O
of	O
the	O
entire	O
